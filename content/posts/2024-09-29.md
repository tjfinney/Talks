## Reading

[Numbers 11.4-11](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Numbers+11%3A4#cv)

## What Ellis Potter said

> The sermon of Peter at Pentecost is a good model.  A sermon should proclaim Christ and invite people to believe in Him.  It should explain Scripture and connect the Old and New Testaments.  It should comfort those who need comforting and rebuke those whose behavior is unchristian.  It should tell stories to illustrate its points. It should apply Scripture to contemporary life and teach people how to live and think as followers of Jesus.  This kind of message is good, rich and nourishing food.  If you are a preacher, preach like this to bless your people.

## Chiasmus

Chapter 4 of Luke's Gospel tells us that Jesus began his mission by reading from the Book of Isaiah:

> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor

> he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted

> to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind

> to set at liberty those who are bruised

> to preach the favorable year of the Lord.

[Luke 4.18-19 AV]

As those who have suffered through my previous messages will know, this is an example of [chiasmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiasmus). The first and last lines have a common theme, as do the second and second last, and so on. This structure emphasizes the central theme, in which case the heart of the matter is:

> to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind

You may also have suffered through another message of mine when I said that the same structure might apply to the Lord's prayer:

> Our Father, who is in heaven, hallowed be your name

> your kingdom come, your will be done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven

> give us today our daily bread

> forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us

> and lead us not into hard testing, but rescue us from evil.

If this is so then God's hallowed name is associated with rescuing us from evil, and God's kingdom is associated with forgiveness of sins (and debts). The central point -- the thing emphasized -- is this:

> Give us today our daily bread


in which case the heart of the matter is this: *Give us today our daily bread*.

Here is a question: Who anointed Jesus? Who do you think it was?
