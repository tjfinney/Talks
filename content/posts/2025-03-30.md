Thank you, Alan, for reading the parable of the prodigal son.

## Joshua 5.9-12

Here is the reading from Joshua:

> The LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away from you the disgrace of Egypt." And so that place is called Gilgal to this day. While the Israelites were camped in Gilgal, they kept the Passover in the evening on the fourteenth day of the month in the plains of Jericho. On the day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and roasted grain. The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land, and the Israelites no longer had manna; they ate the crops of the land of Canaan that year.

[Jos 5.9-12 NRSVue]

Here is Israel about to cross the Jordan. Their old guide, Moses, is dead; their new guide, Joshua, is about to lead them into the promised land. The day they start eating the bread of the land is the day they stop eating the *manna* from heaven. It is a new phase in the life of Israel. They're about to change from what they were -- slaves of Egypt -- into what they will be -- conquerors of nations. 

## Psalm 32

The next Hebrew Bible reading is Psalm 32. Here are the first five verses:

> Happy are those whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

> Happy are those to whom the LORD imputes no iniquity and in whose spirit there is no deceit.

> While I kept silent, my body wasted away through my groaning all day long.

> For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer.

> Then I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not hide my iniquity; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and you forgave the guilt of my sin.

[Ps 32.1-5 NRSVue]

Here is a song about forgiveness. The singer knows he has done wrong. The sin has come between him and God. His conversation with God -- his life of prayer -- has ceased. Through the silence he wastes away, life becomes a drawn out groan, his strength is gone.

What to do? Could he do anything about the sin he's already committed? No. Does he have some kind of excuse? No, he's as guilty as sin. Did he know what he was doing when he did it? Yes. Could he make amends, some kind of sacrifice? Hardly. The problem of his shame before God remains.

So what did he do? He decides to go back to God in his sorry state, knowing full well that he has seriously messed up and deserves retribution.

What is the result? God forgives him.

In Psalm 51 it says,

> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
A broken and a contrite heart, God, You will not despise. 

## 2 Corinthians 5.16-21

One of the New Testament readings for today is from Paul's letters:

>  All this originates with God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ, and given us the ministry of reconciliation, in that through Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not keeping a tally of people's crimes to hold against them, and has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation.

> We, therefore, are Christ's representatives. It's as though God were urging action through us; we appeal to people on behalf of Christ: 'Be reconciled to God.'

> Even though Christ had no personal experience of sinning, God made him a sin offering on our behalf, so that we might come into a right relationship with God through him.

[2 Cor 5.18-21 USC]

God takes the initiative. Christ, the God-man, sacrificed himself to bring about reconciliation. He has paid the price. The women wondered who would move the stone blocking the tomb and found that it had already been rolled away. Back in Joshua, God said 'Today I have rolled away your shame.' Everything needed for reconciliation is already done. As Jesus said on the cross, 'It is accomplished.' This is God's doing. Our part is to acknowledge our need, to be honest with God, to admit our deficit, and then receive a right relationship with God as the gift that it is. What we were powerless to do has been done for us.

There is an unexpected benefit as well. Once we discover the good news that right relationship with God is a pure gift, we can tell others. Do we have to tell everyone? If you're shy you'd rather be poked in the eye with a chop stick. Just tell the ones God tells you to tell. In doing this you become ambassadors for Christ.

## The prodigal son

Finally, we come to the parable of the prodigal son. You will all be glad to hear me say "finally." But wait a minute! I haven't even started talking about the prodigal son yet! Oh no!

Many of you will be familiar with this parable. It's called the gospel within the gospel. It tells us about a child who decides to return to his father despite real and heartfelt shame. It tells us that God is a forgiving father, that he sees us coming from far off and runs to throw his arms around us and hug us, despite our guilt. It speaks too of the older brother, the one with the evil eye, jealous of the good treatment his good for nothing brother receives. It tells us that the father has good things for the older brother as well.

I don't have anything more to say about this parable today. It speaks for itself. However there is something else I'd like to say.

Did anyone notice that the lectionary left out some verses? (Luke 15.4-11 to be precise.) What's in these verses? The answer is, two other parables: the lost sheep and the lost coin. You probably know them already so here's a question to ponder. What could the lost sheep do to get itself found? Any ideas? And what could the lost coin do to get itself found? What do you think? That's how it is with God. We are pretty much powerless but, *halleluyah*,  He comes searching.

Even so, there is something we can work on. All three parables tell us that there is joy in heaven over one wrong-doer who undergoes a change of heart. What kind of change? The kind that Jesus highlights in another parable written down for us by Luke:

> Two men went up to the Temple to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a tax-collector.

> The Pharisee stood there and said this prayer to himself, "I thank you, God, that I am not grasping, unjust, adulterous like the rest of mankind, and particularly that I am not like this tax-collector here. I fast twice a week; I pay tithes on all I get."

> The tax collector stood some distance away, not daring even to raise his eyes to heaven; but he beat his breast and said, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."

> This man, I tell you, went home again at rights with God; the other did not.

[Luke 18.10-14 JB]

The good news is that God is merciful to us. The way to God is open. Our part is to start the journey home.

Amen
