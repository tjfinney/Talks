Naaman

Snakes and spit

The [Homeless Jesus](https://diglib.library.vanderbilt.edu/diglib-fulldisplay.pl?SID=20250624948902246&code=ACT&RC=56969&Row=12) sculpture by Timothy Schmalz. The original sculpture was installed at Regis College, University of Toronto, in 2013. Several other casts are installed around the world. This photo, taken by Mario Roberto DurÃ¡n Ortiz, is of one located at the Dominican Order Church and Convent, Ciudad Colonial, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

## Invocation

Blessed are you our God, creator of the Universe, who said "Let there be light" and there was light.

## Reading for today

Today I'm going rogue and breaking with the lectionary:

* [Gen 1.1-3 (God makes light)](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Genesis+1%3A1#cv)

* [John 1.1-5 (In the beginning was the Word)](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+1%3A1#cv)

* [2 Kings 5.8-14 (Naaman is cured)](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=II+Kings+5%3A8#cv)

* [John 9.1-7 (Celidonius is cured)](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Luke+9%3A51#cv)

## ...


> Nothing in my hands I bring,
> Simply to Thy cross I cling;
> Naked, come to Thee for dress,
> Helpless, look to Thee for grace.

Amen


## Acknowledgments

I lifted the picture of Jesus healing the blind man from the [Pastoral Meanderings](https://pastoralmeanderings.blogspot.com/2023/03/how-bad-can-it-get.html) blog. Bible verses may be from the Authorized Version (AV, 1611), Jerusalem Bible (JB, 1966), Richard K. Moore's *Under the Southern Cross* (USC, 2014; a translation of the New Testament into Australian English), the New American Standard Bible (NASB, 2020), or the New Revised Standard Version Update Edition (NRSVue, 2021). I use [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) a lot.
