## Invocation

Blessed are you our God, creator of the Universe, who spoke creation into being.

## Reading for today

Today I'm going rogue and breaking with the lectionary:

* [Gen 1.1-3 (God makes light)](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Genesis+1%3A1#cv)

* [John 1.1-5 (In the beginning was the Word)](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+1%3A1#cv)

* [John 9.1-7 (Celidonius is cured)](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Luke+9%3A51#cv)

## Context

They say you should look at the context when reading the Bible. Today we will look at John's account of when Jesus cured a man born blind, which is found in the ninth chapter of John's Gospel. The ancient church attributes this Gospel to John, AKA *the disciple whom Jesus loved*. 

Was John full of himself to say that he was the disciple Jesus loved? I think a better explanation is that the people around John -- who helped him write this literary masterpiece (see e.g. [John 21.24](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+21%3A24#cv)) -- were protecting him by not giving out his real name. Being a Christian was becoming more and more hazardous back in the 60s of the first century, and being a leader of the Christian movement was an almost invariably fatal occupation. John was the last left standing of the early Christian leadership: James -- brother of Jesus -- had been killed by the Sanhedrin and Peter and Paul had been killed by Nero. Years earlier, John's own brother, James the Apostle, had been killed by Herod. Herod also would have killed Peter back then if not for the jail break. (See [Acts 12.1-17](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+12%3A1#cv).) The early Christians did other things that fit the pattern of not giving away too much: Luke simply says that *Peter went to another place* in [Acts 12.17](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+12%3A17#cv); the author of Hebrews is not identified; and they used something called [nomina sacra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomina_sacra) when copying their books. (*Nomina sacra* make names look like numbers so a half-literate soldier or policeman might have thought he was looking at tax accounts instead of scriptures.)

John seems to have been one of the youngest of the apostles. He seems to have had connections among the Hebrew aristocracy, the ones known as the Sadducees:

> Josephus, writing at the end of the 1st century CE, associates the sect with the upper echelons of Judean society. As a whole, they fulfilled various political, social, and religious roles, including maintaining the Temple in Jerusalem.

[Sadducees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees)

If the anonymous disciple mentioned at [John 18.15](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+18%3A15#cv) is him, he was known to the High Priest. That's why he could get into the High Priest's house when Jesus was taken there after being arrested in [Gethsemane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gethsemane) (which, by the way, means *oil press*). 

Being a Hebrew, John would have been fed on the Hebrew Bible from an early age. The Eastern Orthodox Church calls him *John the Theologian*. He knows all about the Exodus, the festivals, and what they celebrate. He knows all about the God of the Hebrews and the names by which he is known, including the [I Am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton) name that God told Moses when Moses said *Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?*.

John was a man of numbers. He tells us there were six water jars of two or three measures each at Cana. According to my Jerusalem Bible's table of weights and measures, a Greek measure is about 39.4 L. That means that Jesus made the equivalent of somewhere between 630 and 945 bottles of good wine for the wedding guests. John also likes the number seven. In his Gospel there are seven signs that Jesus does that Hebrews know only God can do: changing water into wine; curing at a distance; curing someone crippled for decades; feeding thousands of people with a boy's lunch; walking on water; curing someone born blind; and raising someone who was well and truly dead. Jesus also has seven *I am* titles in John's Gospel: *I am the bread of life* ([John 6.35](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+6%3A35#cv)); *I am the light of the world* ([8.12](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+8%3A12#cv)); *I am the gate* ([10.7](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+10%3A7#cv)); *I am the good shepherd* ([10.11](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+10%3A11#cv)); *I am the resurrection and the life* ([11.25](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+11%3A25#cv)), *I am the way, the truth, and the life* ([14.6](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+14%3A6#cv)); and *I am the true vine* ([15.1](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+15%3A1#cv)). Or should that be eight? Jesus also says *πριν αβρααμ γενεσθαι εγω ειμι*; that is, *before Abraham was born, I am* ([John 8.58](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+8%3A58#cv)).
