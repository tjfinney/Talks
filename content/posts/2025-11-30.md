## Readings for today

Here are two of today's [lectionary readings](https://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/texts/?y=17134&z=a&d=1):

> The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

> In days to come the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established as the highest of the mountains and shall be raised above the hills; all the nations shall stream to it.

> Many peoples shall come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth instruction and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

> He shall judge between the nations and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more.

> O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD!

[Isaiah 2.1-5 NRSVue](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Isaiah+2%3A1#cv)

> "But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

> For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

> For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,

> and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so, too, will be the coming of the Son of Man.

> Then two will be in the field; one will be taken, and one will be left.

> Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken, and one will be left.

> Keep awake, therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.

> But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.

> Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."

[Matt 24.36-44 NRSVue](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Matthew+24%3A36#cv)

## First day of Advent

Today is the first day of Advent and the first day of a new liturgical year in Western Christianity.

> Advent begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas (the Sunday that falls on or closest to 30 November, always between 27 November and 3 December).

[Wikipedia: Advent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent)

Advent is a time of preparation: a time to meditate on Christ's first Advent, when he came into the world, and his second Advent, when he will return again.

## What Advent has become

It's hard to miss what Advent has become: shopping frenzies and boozy parties. Talk about a God-shaped hole: Jesus used to be at the centre but now it's hard to find any sign of him. It's amazing how completely he has been written out of the Christmas script. The meaning behind Christmas is missing. There are reindeers, snowy trees, and rotund men in red suits but nothing about the Word of God who became a human being. Happily the revision is not quite complete. There are still some reminders, like our nativity scene exhibition. Thank you everyone who was involved in organizing that.

What can we do in a time like this? Perhaps it would be a good idea to focus on the other aspect of Advent, the second Advent rather than the first, the time when Jesus Christ will return to put things right. How do we prepare for his arrival?

## Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the Lord

Jesus is a king. If a king were coming here, how would we prepare? There are certain protocols to be observed. An important one is to discover the king's agenda then get to work on making it happen.

The reading from Isaiah starts as follows:

> In days to come the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established as the highest of the mountains and shall be raised above the hills; all the nations shall stream to it.

> Many peoples shall come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths."

If we think of the Mountain of the Lord's House as the Kingdom of God then we can see that the nations have been streaming to it. Nations have indeed been coming to the one who God has made king, namely Jesus Christ. This continues today in spite of fierce resistance. Our king is also a teacher, and the nations have been learning his ways so that they may walk in his paths. What evidence is there for that? In what ways have the nations learnt his ways and walked in his paths?

The first Advent of Jesus took place in a historical context. His people, the Jewish people, were ruled by a foreign power, the Roman Empire. His people were waiting for a deliverer to rid them of the overlords and were expecting him to do so by military might. However, this king taught another way, and here is a taste of it from his Sermon on the Mount:

> Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

> Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.

> Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.

> You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy’ but I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may prove yourselves to be children of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

> If you forgive other people their debts, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive other people, then your Father will not forgive your debts.

> Do not be worried about your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to what you will put on. Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the sky: they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather crops into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more important than they? And can worrying about anything add a single day to your lifespan?

> In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

> Everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain fell and the floods came, the winds blew and slammed against that house. Yet it did not fall because it had been founded on the rock. However, everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. The rain fell and the floods came, the winds blew and slammed against that house. It fell, and what a fall it had.

[Extracts from the Sermon on the Mount; Matthew chapters 5-7](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Matthew+5%3A1#cv)

At the time the Roman Empire did not take a lot of notice of what Jesus said. In fact, one of their people had him executed. However, he did not stay dead.

Enlivened by his Spirit, his followers spread his teaching and put it into practice. The Empire had a habit of getting rid of unwanted children by exposing them -- that is leaving them out in the open to die or be collected by slavers and forced into a life of misery. Christians put an end to that practice, taking the children in, teaching them a trade, giving them the means for a decent life. The Empire left the sick to themselves; Christians invented hospitals. The Empire entertained themselves with fights to the death; a monk named [Telemachus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Telemachus) ended that. He went to the games and made his way into the arena. Standing between the gladiators he said, *In the name of Christ, Stop.* The crowd began to hiss, picked up stones, and killed him. Then a shudder of shame ran through the Colosseum. One by one they left. In response to this incident Emperor Honorius, himself a Christian, banned gladiatorial fights.

The spread of Christ's teaching and its influence continued. Royal families made Christ their king. Look at the flags and see the crosses. This was more than just window dressing. Piece by piece the machinery of oppression was dismantled. Slaves were set free, the poor were given a living wage, the unschooled were given an education, child labour was banned, insane asylums were reformed, workers were given a day of rest, animal cruelty was prevented, the powerless were protected and given the right to speak and vote. All of these achievements had Christian champions: names like [William Wilberforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce), [Lord Shaftesbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Ashley-Cooper,_7th_Earl_of_Shaftesbury), and [Catherine Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Booth) come to mind.

## Not a walk in the park

This was no walk in the park. There was push back against every step on the road to emancipation. People were convinced that doing away with slavery would ruin the economy. Giving the poor a decent life meant higher wages -- that's bad for business, isn't it? Educating people meant there would be less people to do menial work. Getting rid of child labour meant that you would have to make chimneys wider. Who knows what would go wrong if you gave women a voice?

As it turns out the economy did not crash. Instead things went better. More education meant more progress. More wages meant more spending power. Giving workers a day off meant leisure time -- now they wanted to buy a piano or a car or a swimming pool. What seemed like economic madness turned out to be fiscal genius. It's like that when we do what is right -- God blesses it and things mysteriously multiply.

## Costly grace

There was an air of optimism at the beginning of the twentieth century. Things were improving, science was advancing, people were living better lives. Then came the First World War and Christian nations started to murder each other on an industrial scale. They used newly invented explosives, poisons, and whatever means they could. Twenty-six million shells were fired in the 300 days of the Battle of Verdun -- that's six shells for every square metre of land. Humanity was forgotten, passenger ships were sunk, civilians were bombed, children were killed. My grandfather saw the horrors of France. He could not believe in a God of love after what he had seen. You couldn't let the back door slam because he had shell shock. War exacts a terrible price; *that* is something we must never forget. Almost everyone in Australia identified as a Christian before the First World War. After that war the men began to fall away.

Twenty years later the world went to war again. Before the Second World War started, a theology student named Dietrich Bonhoeffer was warning people that fascism was bad news. According to Wikipedia,

> Two days after Hitler was installed as chancellor, Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the Führer (leader), who he argued might well turn out to be verführer ("misleader", "seducer"). His broadcast was abruptly cut off.

Though a sworn pacifist, Bonhoeffer became part of a plot to get rid of Hitler.

> Bonhoeffer was accused of being associated with the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler and was tried along with other accused plotters, including former members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office). He was hanged on 9 April 1945 during the collapse of the Nazi regime. 

[Wikipedia: Dietrich Bonhoeffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer)

Bonhoeffer could have avoided that fate. People in the USA and the UK wanted to get him out of Germany to protect him. He had even been invited to study non-violent resistance under Mahatma Gandhi in his ashram in India. However, Bonhoeffer decided to stay in Germany to support the Church there. He made this decision knowing the cost. He wrote a book called *The Cost of Discipleship*, which is a study on the Sermon on the Mount. In it he contrasts cheap grace and costly grace:

> Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, communion without confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate.

[Wikipedia: The Cost of Discipleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cost_of_Discipleship)

You might not know it, but Mahatma Gandhi was a student of the Bible and especially of the Sermon on the Mount. According to one account, a missionary met Ghandi and said, *Though you quote the words of Christ often, why is that you appear to so adamantly reject becoming his follower?* Ghandi replied, *Oh, I don’t reject your Christ. I love your Christ. It’s just that so many of you Christians are so unlike your Christ.*

My wife Eliane and I used to live in Atlanta, USA. That's where Ebenezer Baptist Church is. Someone named Martin Luther King Jnr used to preach there. In the USA they call him MLK. Over the road from the church is a US National Park that commemorates MLK's life and the US Civil Rights Movement. In that park is a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. King once said, *Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics.* Up the road a bit is MLK's tomb.

You may have noticed that Eliane is brown. She is from Brasil, a country that got rich on the back of slavery. We lived on the outskirts of Atlanta in a place called Stone Mountain. MLK actually mentions Stone Mountain in his *I have a dream* speech. He said, *Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.* That's not because it was a good place but a bad place, the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan. If Eliane and I had lived there in the 1960s we would have felt the heat; maybe we would have had a brick or a bomb through the window. As it was, we lived there in peace and received nothing but kindness from the locals. The people there are over the bad old ways. Martin Luther King Junior and the Civil Rights Movement had something to do with making America better.

## Swords into ploughshares

The reading from Isaiah continues on:

> He shall judge between the nations and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more.

After World War Two the world seemed to be over wars for a while. The United Nations was set up to foster good relations. In 1959 the Soviet Union presented the United Nations with a bronze sculpture by Yevgeny Vuchetich -- it shows a man beating a sword into a ploughshare and Isaiah's words are inscribed upon it. 

Everyone agrees that this is a wonderful vision. However, looking at the last hundred years makes us wonder if it's just a dream. 

Where do we go from here? Is there any hope of Isaiah's prophecy becoming reality? Can it be that *nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more*?

In the thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians, Saint Paul talks about love. He ends his sublime exposition by saying:

> these three remain: faith, hope, and love; and the greatest of these is love.

[1 Cor 13.13, TEV](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=I+Corinthians+13%3A13#cv)

*Faith* means trust, belief, and reliance. The one we trust is Jesus. Those who trust him in small things will grow to trust him in greater things. Never despise small beginnings.

*Hope* is hard to define. It is easy to define the opposite -- hopelessness is something we all know about. The one who has the power to transform a hopeless situation into a life giving bounty is the Christ, the Son of the Living God.

*Love* is *agape* love -- the love of a parent for a child -- the love that never gives up. Jesus taught us that God is love. Through God's love we have the power to do all things, even to teach nations to learn war no more.

Beating swords into ploughshares takes work. Wilberforce devoted his entire life to ending slavery. The work to end oppression, to bring hope to those without hope, has cost people their lives. Nevertheless, it is the best way to spend a life. Christ's mission is to bring good news to the poor, to set the captives free, to proclaim the year of God's favour. And through Christ we too can play a part.

> Truly He taught us to love one another;

> His law is love and His gospel is peace.

> Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother;

> And in His name all oppression shall cease.

Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the Lord.

Amen
