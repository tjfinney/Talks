<p>What Christians now call <em>communion</em> or the <em>Last Supper</em> began as a Passover Meal that Jesus shared with his disciples the night before he was crucified. Jesus told his disciples to remember him whenever they had that meal. At a previous service we looked at certain aspects of the bread. Tonight we will look at certain aspects of the wine.</p>
<p>The Passover meal has four cups of wine but we will only have two cups tonight. We will drink grape juice, which is just as well because too many cups of wine put you over the limit. There will be something to remember about Jesus for each cup.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try to make this short. My dear mother, Dorothy Finney, used to tell me that the best preacher she ever heard was a man named Bill Young. (She heard a lot of preachers in her life.) Bill Young was known as a prince among preachers. Mum said that his messages didn&rsquo;t go longer than fifteen minutes and that they were unforgetable. My beautiful wife Eliane dearly hopes that I will be like Bill Young one day.</p>

<h2 id="why-four-cups">Why four cups?</h2>
<p>Why does the Passover Meal have four cups of wine? The <em>Mishnah</em> is a collection of Jewish teaching, and it associates the four cups with four acts that God promises in Exodus 6.6-7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say, therefore, to the sons of Israel, &lsquo;I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage. I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. Then I will take you for My people&rsquo; [Ex 6.6-7, NASB]</p></blockquote>
<p>The four cups are about God bringing His people out from under the burdens of Pharoah, deliverance from bondage, powerful redemption, and adoption.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-and-wine">Jesus and wine</h2>
<p>Seeing that Jesus told us to remember him, I thought we could remember a couple of things about Jesus and wine tonight. What do you think about when you think of Jesus and wine?</p>
<p>Here are the two things I&rsquo;d like to remember about Jesus tonight:</p>
<ul>
<li>when Jesus talked about being the vine</li>
<li>when Jesus turned water into wine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-true-vine">The true vine</h2>
<p>John&rsquo;s Gospel tells us that Jesus said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the vine and you are the branches. Whoever remains in Me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. [John 15.5]</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus tells us that we can do nothing unless we are connected to him. What kind of statement is that? Who is this Jesus? Why can&rsquo;t I do anything without him?</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s Gospel starts by saying that Jesus is the λογοσ, the Word of God. Or, to put it another way, Jesus is God&rsquo;s speech personified. When God speaks, things happen. By his creative speech, God created the universe. In saying that Jesus is the Word of God, John is not just saying that Jesus is divine but that he is the instrument of existence, the ground of being. If that is who Jesus really is, then we can do amazing things by getting connected to him. He is the source of true life. God, please graft us into the true vine and keep us there.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get our &ldquo;wine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here is the Hebrew blessing for wine:</p>
<p>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָפֶן</p>
<p>Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, Melekh ha&rsquo;olam, bo&rsquo;re p&rsquo;ri hagefen.</p>
<p>Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who creates the fruit of the vine.</p>
<p>Here is how you say <em>Jesus Christ, the true vine</em> in Portuguese:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus Christo, a videira verdadeira.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you please, say this with us then drink.</p>
<h2 id="water-into-wine">Water into wine</h2>
<p>John the Apostle loves the number seven. In his Gospel he tells us about seven things that Jesus did that are so stupendous that John calls them <em>signs</em>. Signs of what, you may ask. The answer has to be, signs that Jesus is divine. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Signs">signs</a> filled those who witnessed them with awe: turning water into wine, healing an official&rsquo;s son, healing a paralysed man, feeding thousands, walking on water, healing a man born blind, and bringing Lazarus back to life.</p>
<p>The first sign happened at a wedding. Either through bad planning or excessive drinking, they ran out of wine. Jesus&rsquo; Mum says, <em>They&rsquo;ve run out of wine.</em> Then Jesus says something that you could translate as <em>So what?</em> Neverthless he tells the waiters to fill up some big containers with water then to take some to the organizer. They did that and the organizer said <em>Normally they bring out the best wine first and leave the worst for last. But you&rsquo;ve kept the best for last.</em></p>
<p>This is a prodigious miracle. Not only did Jesus make good wine but he made a <em>lot</em> of it. John says there were six containers with a capacity of two or three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_units_of_measurement#Volume">metrētēs</a> each. The standard metrētēs contains about 39 litres. Taking <em>two or three</em> to be two and a half, that means that Jesus made about 585 litres of wine!</p>
<p>The quantity is impressive, but even more impressive is that he made water into wine. The blessing that the Hebrews say over wine says, <em>Blessed are you our God, who makes the vine produce wine.</em> Making water into wine is something the Hebrews attribute to God.</p>
<p>How can Jesus be the Word of God? How can a person become convinced that this is true? John wrote his Gospel to help. He says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These things have been recorded so that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, God&rsquo;s Son, and that by believing you may have life by means of his Name. [John 20.31, <em>Under the Southern Cross</em> (USC), trans. Richard K. Moore]</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks like God plays a big part in people becoming convinced about the true identity of Jesus. Here&rsquo;s something from Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, He was asking His disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” And they said, “Some say John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.” He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. [Matt 16.13-17, NASB]</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone who is not sure can ask God to show them who Jesus really is.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s fill our cups again.</p>
<p>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה אֲדֹנָי אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָפֶן</p>
<p>Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, Melekh ha&rsquo;olam, bo&rsquo;re p&rsquo;ri hagefen.</p>
<p>Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who creates the fruit of the vine.</p>
<p>Here is how you say <em>Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God</em> in Portuguese:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus Cristo, o Filho do Deus vivo.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you please, say this with us then drink.</p>
<h2 id="bread-of-life">Bread of life</h2>
<p>In John&rsquo;s first sign, Jesus does something that the Hebrews normally attribute to God: he creates the fruit of the vine. A bit later John records another sign, and it is another thing that the Hebrews normally attribute to God. This time, Jesus makes a lot of bread from a little bit: he feeds thousands of people with five loaves and two fish. You know the story well so I will just give you what it says at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.” [John 6.14 NASB]</p></blockquote>
<p>Afterwards Jesus could tell that the crowd wanted to make him king by force so he headed for the hills. His disciples got into a boat and started rowing across Lake Galilee, which is about 15 km wide. It got dark and they were only about a third of the way when Jesus came up to them walking on water. John says that they got to the place they were going as soon as he got into the boat.</p>
<p>The next day the crowd went looking for Jesus. Here&rsquo;s what John says happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?” Jesus answered them and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled. Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.” Therefore they said to Him, “What shall we do, so that we may work the works of God?” Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.” [John 6.25-29, NASB]</p></blockquote>
<p>A little bit later, Jesus says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the bread of life. Those coming to me will not hunger, and those believing in me will never thirst [John 6.35]</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give out the bread.</p>
<p>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה&rsquo;, אֱ-לֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, הַמּוֹצִיא לֶחֶם מִן הָאָרֶץ</p>
<p>Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha&rsquo;olam, hamotzi lehem min ha&rsquo;aretz.</p>
<p>Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who brings forth bread from the earth.</p>
<p>Here is how you say <em>Jesus Christ, the bread of life</em> in Portuguese:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus Cristo, o pão da vida</p></blockquote>
<p>If you please, say this with us then eat.</p>
<p>God bless you and make his face shine upon you. Amen.</p>
