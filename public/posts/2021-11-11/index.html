You know you are in a theology lesson when you hear someone start talking about the Graeco-Roman letter form.
Here is a letter writing pattern we tend to use these days:

Dear &hellip;


Blah, blah, blah&hellip;


Yours sincerely,


&hellip;

We put the person&rsquo;s name at the start and our own name at the end.
Here&rsquo;s what you are likely to find in a typical Graeco-Roman letter:

Key parties (&ldquo;From X to Y&rdquo;)
A greeting or blessing
The letter&rsquo;s content
A farewell.

The letters in the New Testament follow this kind of pattern. Let&rsquo;s look at one in particular: the Third Letter of John (3 John). It starts by saying who it is from and who it is to:">

<p>You know you are in a theology lesson when you hear someone start talking about the Graeco-Roman letter form.</p>
<p>Here is a letter writing pattern we tend to use these days:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Blah, blah, blah&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We put the person&rsquo;s name at the start and our own name at the end.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you are likely to find in a <a href="http://www.crivoice.org/ntletters.html">typical Graeco-Roman letter</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Key parties (&ldquo;From X to Y&rdquo;)</li>
<li>A greeting or blessing</li>
<li>The letter&rsquo;s content</li>
<li>A farewell.</li>
</ol>
<p>The letters in the New Testament follow this kind of pattern. Let&rsquo;s look at one in particular: the Third Letter of John (3 John). It starts by saying who it is from and who it is to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next there is a greeting or blessing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blessing continues on until verse 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then comes the body of the letter, where &ldquo;the elder&rdquo; says what he wants to say. Here&rsquo;s a summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaius is encouraged to treat &ldquo;the brothers&rdquo; well because they deserve his support</li>
<li>&ldquo;the elder&rdquo; warns about someone called Diotrephes, who has not treated the brothers so well. (In fact, this Diotrephes has kicked out those people who wanted to welcome the brothers.)</li>
<li>The elder encourages Gaius to imitate good, not evil: &ldquo;The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, the elder gives an endorsement for someone named Demetrius, saying that he has &ldquo;received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Demetrius is probably the letter carrier &ndash; the one who had been given the job of taking the letter from the elder to Gaius.</p>
<p>After saying that he wants to say more but not in writing, the elder finishes with a farewell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is the elder?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s all this about Diotrephes? Why is he kicking people out of the church?</li>
<li>Why doesn&rsquo;t the elder want to put the things he has to say in writing?</li>
</ol>
<p>Some clues might be found by looking at the Second Letter of John (2 John). It starts off with these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that doesn&rsquo;t help much. Who&rsquo;s this chosen lady? The letter ends with the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The children of your chosen sister greet you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One possibility is that the elder is using code names to refer to himself (&ldquo;the elder&rdquo;) and to churches (&ldquo;the chosen lady&rdquo;, &ldquo;the chosen sister&rdquo;). Why use code words? Why avoid putting things down in writing?</p>
<p>The rest of 2 John could be thought of as an introduction to the First Letter of John, explaining some of the key terms and giving a bit of context to the themes found in that letter.</p>
<p>Maybe the three letters of John should be read in reverse order? First comes 3 John, being the cover letter for Gaius. Second comes 2 John, being the cover letter for the &ldquo;chosen lady&rdquo; church. (Which church would the &ldquo;chosen lady&rdquo; be?) Third come 1 John, containing the message that the elder wants to get to the chosen lady church.</p>
<p>If so, why did they end up in the wrong order? The reason might be a habit of whoever collected the New Testament letters: letters to the same group (e.g. 1 and 2 Corinthians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians) are arranged in order of decreasing length.</p>
