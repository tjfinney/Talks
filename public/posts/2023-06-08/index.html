<blockquote>
<p>Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church, to do them harm. And he had James the brother of John executed with a sword. When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter as well. (Now these were the days of Unleavened Bread.) When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, turning him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending only after the Passover to bring him before the people. So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made to God intensely by the church.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison. And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly stood near Peter, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter’s side and woke him, saying, “Get up quickly.” And his chains fell off his hands. And the angel said to him, “Put on your belt and strap on your sandals.” And he did so. And he said to him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.” And he went out and continued to follow, and yet he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. Now when they had passed the first and second guard, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.” And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. When he knocked at the door of the gate, a slave girl named Rhoda came to answer. When she recognized Peter’s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate. They said to her, “You are out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so. They said, “It is his angel.” But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened the door, they saw him and were amazed. But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, “Report these things to James and the brothers.” Then he left and went to another place.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+12%3A1#cv">Acts 12.1-17 NASB</a></p>
<p>Some will remember the fuss about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_code">Bible Code</a> that happened in the 1990s. It was about skipping equal numbers of letters in the Hebrew Bible and finding messages there. For example, writing down the first four letters all separated by fifty letters starting with the first <em>taw</em> in Exodus spells out <em>Torah</em>, which is <em>Law</em> in Hebrew.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Code-Exodus-ELS.jpg" alt="Equidistant letter sequence in Exodus"></p>
<p>Today we won&rsquo;t be talking about that at all. Instead, we&rsquo;ll look at codes, hidden messages, and witness protection in the New Testament. I should warn you that there is a fair bit of speculation in what follows. There are diverse opinions on dates and just about every other aspect of what we will cover. My only defense of the version about to be presented is that it seems to hold water, though you will have to judge that for yourselves. Today&rsquo;s message won&rsquo;t score highly on the spiritual edification scale, though it may give you new ways to think about some obscure parts of the New Testament. Nevertheless, come Holy Spirit, enlighten us, and bless us with your presence.</p>
<h1 id="something-easy-to-miss">Something easy to miss</h1>
<p>What does the reading from Acts have to do with any of this? Years ago I was reading a commentary by Karen Jobes on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peter-Baker-Exegetical-Commentary-Testament/dp/0801026741">Peter&rsquo;s First Letter</a>. She pointed out something that is easy to miss, and that is the last sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then he left and went to another place.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is about the last place we hear of Peter in Acts because the rest of Luke&rsquo;s book focuses on Paul. Where did Peter go and why aren&rsquo;t we given more information? Karen Jobes thinks it&rsquo;s because Luke is protecting him and purposely not saying where he is.</p>
<p>When you think about it, the preceding text about Peter being sprung from jail by the Lord&rsquo;s angel has all of the hallmarks of an eye witness account. There are things that you wouldn&rsquo;t write down unless that&rsquo;s the way it actually happened, like Rhoda running off to tell the others &ndash; without letting Peter in &ndash; and the people who had been praying for his release not believing that Peter was there. How would Luke have known this stuff? One explanation is that he was sitting across from Peter, writing down his words as he told the story. Where did Peter go? Luke knew exactly where, but didn&rsquo;t want to write it down in case someone got hold of his book and managed to trace Peter through it.</p>
<p>All this sounds a bit fantastic doesn&rsquo;t it? Well, Peter <em>was</em> on the run from Herod, the duly appointed Roman ruler. It was increasingly dangerous to be a leader of the early Christian movement. Herod had already done away with the Apostle James &ndash; John&rsquo;s brother &ndash; and saw how much it pleased the crowd. Herod was planning to do the same thing to Peter when the Lord&rsquo;s angel broke him out of jail.</p>
<h1 id="early-leaders">Early leaders</h1>
<p>Four people stand out as pillars of the early church. Any guesses who? One was James, not the one who had just been killed but James the brother of Jesus. The second was Peter, the third was Paul, and the fourth was John. (Paul names James, Peter, and John as pillars at <a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Galatians+2%3A9#cv">Galatians 2.9</a>.) It looks like James was in charge of the mission to Hebrew-speaking Jews in Judea, Peter went to the Greek-speaking Jews in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey), and Paul went to the non-Jews wherever they were. Later on it looks like John had oversight of the work in Asia Minor.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Asia-Minor.jpg" alt="Asia Minor"></p>
<h1 id="an-aside">An aside</h1>
<p>As an aside, this strategic division of the work to take Jesus&rsquo; Good News into the whole world might help to explain an otherwise mystifying episode recorded in Acts chapter 16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, after being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them; and passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+16%3A6#cv">Acts 16.6-8 NASB</a></p>
<p>Does that mean that Jesus doesn&rsquo;t like Asians and doesn&rsquo;t want them to hear the Gospel? Clearly not. Here&rsquo;s the start of Peter&rsquo;s first letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as strangers, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=I+Peter+1%3A1#cv">1 Peter 1 NASB</a></p>
<p>An alternative explanation is that Jesus didn&rsquo;t need Paul to go that way because Peter was already working there.</p>
<h1 id="back-to-the-four-pillars">Back to the four pillars</h1>
<p>Getting back to the four pillars, you can draw lines between them and the four Gospels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>James is associated with Matthew. (Matthew puts an emphasis on fulfillment of Hebrew scripture and the Letter of James has numerous points of contact with Matthew&rsquo;s Sermon on the Mount.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark is associated with Peter. (The John Mark mentioned in the reading from Acts is the Mark who wrote the Gospel. In fact it is possible that this Mark is Peter&rsquo;s actual son. An early Christian writer named Papias says, <em>Mark became Peter&rsquo;s interpreter and wrote down accurately, but not in order, all that he remembered of the things said and done by the Lord.</em> [Eusebius, <em>Church History</em>, 3.39.])</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luke is associated with Paul. (Luke travelled around with Paul and is mentioned in some of Paul&rsquo;s letters.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John is associated with John (though you won&rsquo;t find a single mention of him by name in John&rsquo;s Gospel or John&rsquo;s three letters).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="demise-of-james-peter-and-paul">Demise of James, Peter, and Paul</h1>
<p>In 62 AD, around the time Luke wrote Acts, James the brother of Jesus was killed by the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem. Paul was still waiting to have his case heard before the highest authority in Rome. As a Roman citizen, he had the right of appeal to Caesar. Not a bad plan &ndash; if he was successful it would be legal under Roman law to spread the word about Jesus. Unfortunately, the Caesar at that time was Nero. According to one Roman historian, Nero wanted to rebuild a large part of Rome so arranged to have it burnt down. When people started to suspect that he was responsible, Nero accused the Christians of perpetrating the crime. This is remarkable given that a short time earlier they had been an obscure group in an out of the way part of the Empire. Perhaps Paul&rsquo;s appeal backfired because after presenting his defence of Christianity, Nero had a group to blame for his own villainous acts.</p>
<p>If the early Christians were taking steps to protect their leadership, it didn&rsquo;t work for Peter and Paul. Both were executed around 65 AD during the persecution of Christians that followed the fire of Rome. After this, the only one of the four pillars left standing was John.</p>
<h1 id="protecting-john">Protecting John</h1>
<p>John&rsquo;s Gospel doesn&rsquo;t mention him by name anywhere. Instead it calls him the <em>beloved disciple</em> or <em>the disciple whom Jesus loved</em>. The three Letters of John don&rsquo;t mention him by name either, instead calling him <em>the Elder</em>. Who is responsible for hiding John&rsquo;s name? It seems that there was a group of believers around John: maybe it was their idea? Here is the end of John&rsquo;s Gospel from Richard Moore&rsquo;s translation of the New Testament into Australian English named <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Under-Southern-Cross-Testament-Australian/dp/1490854037">Under the Southern Cross</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said to him [i.e. Peter], &lsquo;Look after my sheep. I am telling you the solemn truth: when you were younger, you dressed yourself and got about wherever you wanted; but when you&rsquo;re old, you&rsquo;ll stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and will take you where you don&rsquo;t want to go.&rsquo; (He said this to indicate the way in which Peter was to die and bring glory to God.) After he&rsquo;d said this, he said to him, &lsquo;Follow me.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter turned around and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them (the one who had lain back against his chest at the meal and asked, &lsquo;Master, who is it who&rsquo;s betraying you?&rsquo;). So having seen him, Peter asked Jesus, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s to become of him, Master?&rsquo; Jesus replied, &lsquo;If I want him to stay until I come, what&rsquo;s that got to do with you? You follow me.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result, this rumour spread among the believers that that disciple wouldn&rsquo;t die. However, Jesus didn&rsquo;t tell him he wouldn&rsquo;t die, but only said, &lsquo;If I want him to stay until I come, what&rsquo;s that got to do with you?&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the disciple who testifies about these matters and who committed them to writing, and we know that his testimony is true. There are many other things that Jesus did as well, which, if each were to be recorded, I guess the world itself wouldn&rsquo;t have the room for the books that would be written!</p></blockquote>
<p>[John 21.17-25 USC]</p>
<p>Did you notice the mention of the group? <em>We know that his testimony is true.</em> Perhaps they were the ones who wanted to keep John&rsquo;s identity hidden to protect him? But if that&rsquo;s the case, why did they say Peter&rsquo;s name in the clear (i.e. not using code)? It looks like Peter is already in glory, beyond the reach of his enemies. A sobering thought is that all of the seven apostles mentioned by name in John&rsquo;s Gospel had already been killed, though it&rsquo;s possible that some were beyond Rome&rsquo;s reach, like Thomas who had taken the message of Christ to India.</p>
<h1 id="put-away-your-sword">Put away your sword</h1>
<p>Before moving on with John, let&rsquo;s look at possible instances of identity protection and code relating to Peter. Church tradition says the time sequence of Gospels is Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, though the Matthew there may be a Hebrew Gospel that preceded the Greek one we have now.</p>
<p>When Jesus was arrested in the garden of Gethsemane, one of his followers cut off the high priest&rsquo;s slave&rsquo;s ear. Matthew, Mark, and Luke agree in not saying who did it. Here&rsquo;s what Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel says (reading from the NASB):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, who came from the chief priests and elders of the people. Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign previously, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the one; arrest Him.” And immediately Judas went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him. But Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you have come for.” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him. And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword. “Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels? “How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen this way?”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Matthew+26%3A47#cv">Matt 26.47-54 NASB</a></p>
<p>Now for what John&rsquo;s Gospel says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Jesus had spoken these words, He went away with His disciples across the ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden which He entered with His disciples. Now Judas, who was betraying Him, also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples. So Judas, having obtained the Roman cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, came out into the open and said to them, “Whom are you seeking?” They answered Him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He said to them, “I am He.” And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them. Now then, when He said to them, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground. He then asked them again, “Whom are you seeking?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.” Jesus answered, “I told you that I am He; so if you are seeking Me, let these men go on their way.” This took place so that the word which He spoke would be fulfilled: “Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one.” Then Simon Peter, since he had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave’s name was Malchus. So Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, am I not to drink it?”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+18%3A1#cv">John 18.1-11 NASB</a></p>
<p>John gives us the perpetrator&rsquo;s identity &ndash; it was Peter. Again, by the time John&rsquo;s Gospel was written, it was fine to identify Peter because he was now beyond reach. The other person named, Malchus, had nothing to fear from being identified because he was the victim.</p>
<p>The last piece to do with Peter is the end of his first letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=I+Peter+5%3A12#cv">1 Peter 5.12-14</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of interesting things here: Silvanus (also known as Silas) helped Peter with his letter, Peter calls Mark his son, and Peter sends greetings from <em>she who is in Babylon</em>. Focusing on the last one, you can read <em>she who is in Babylon</em> as code for <em>the church in Rome</em>. Peter is not the only New Testament author who uses <em>Babylon</em> as code for <em>Rome</em>.</p>
<h1 id="johns-letters">John&rsquo;s letters</h1>
<p>Getting back to John, there&rsquo;s another place where it looks like his identity is being protected, namely the three Letters of John. Taking them in countdown order &ndash; 3, 2, 1 &ndash; 3 John is a perfect example of the Graeco-Roman letter format:</p>
<ul>
<li>From [insert sender&rsquo;s name here]</li>
<li>To [insert recipient&rsquo;s name here]</li>
<li>Greetings and blessings to the recipient</li>
<li>Blah, blah, blah</li>
<li>More greetings and blessings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 3 John the sender, John, is called <em>the Elder</em>. The recipient, Gaius, is written in the clear, perhaps because there are plenty of people named Gaius but only one John who is a principal leader of the Christian movement and whose identity his companions may be trying to protect.</p>
<p>2 John looks like a key for deciphering certain things. The sender is again called <em>the Elder</em>, i.e. John. This time the recipient is the <em>chosen Lady and her children</em>, similar to the code Peter uses for the church in Rome, except that John&rsquo;s letter does not name the place where the church he is writing to is located. 2 John contains some keys to understanding, including these two:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>This is what love is all about: that we live by his commandments</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Many deceivers are at large in the world; they don&rsquo;t acknowledge that Jesus Christ has come as a human being. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[2 John 6-7 USC]</p>
<p>Then comes 1 John, which contains the Elder&rsquo;s full message.</p>
<h1 id="revelation">Revelation</h1>
<p>At last we come to <em>Revelation</em>, the <em>Apocalypse of John</em>. <em>Apocalypse</em> can mean <em>uncovering</em> (e.g. of the head), <em>disclosing</em> (of hidden springs), <em>revelation</em> (of divine mysteries), or <em>manifestation</em> (of persons). Given this range of meaning, it is ironic that John&rsquo;s vision is full of code. However, if you know the code then things become clearer.</p>
<p>You will be glad to hear that I am not covering all of the code in Revelation but will only give a broad outline and focus on one particular piece of code before finishing.</p>
<p>The first three verses of Revelation are an introduction that looks like it is from a group of people who know John. Then it says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood&ndash;and He made us into a kingdom, priests to His God and Father&ndash;to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen. “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I, John, your brother and fellow participant in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like the sound of a trumpet, saying, “Write on a scroll what you see, and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And after turning I saw seven golden lampstands; and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and wrapped around the chest with a golden sash. His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire. His feet were like burnished bronze when it has been heated to a glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He placed His right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid; I am the first and the last, and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades. “Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things. “As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Revelation+of+John+1%3A4#cv">Rev 1.4-20 NASB</a></p>
<p>Well, so much for my claim that they are trying to protect John&rsquo;s identity because the first thing he does is give his name! However, there&rsquo;s not much point keeping your identity secret once the Romans have got you: John has been arrested and exiled to Patmos, off the coast of modern-day Turkey.</p>
<p>John hears then sees the risen Christ the <em>Alpha and the Omega, the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty</em>. John falls down as if dead &ndash; like what happened to Daniel when he had a similar experience on the banks of the Ulai River.</p>
<p>This awesome figure revived John and told him to <em>write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things</em> to seven churches in Asia Minor: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.</p>
<p>The first three chapters of Revelation are comprised of letters to the seven churches. By the way, the content of the letter to Ephesus has points of contact with the three letters of John we looked at before.</p>
<p>Next come chapters four and five. In chapter four John is taken up to heaven where he sees a throne and one sitting on the throne &ndash; John doesn&rsquo;t say his name but makes clear that it is the Lord God Almighty, who is being worshipped by everyone around Him. In chapter five John sees a lamb who has been sacrificed. He is identified as the <em>Lion of the tribe of Judah</em> and the <em>Root of David</em>. For those in the know, these are clear identifications of Jesus Christ. How amazing that John, the Jew who worships the One God, then sees those around the throne fall down and worship the Lamb. Here we have what John never says explicitly in his Gospel but does say implicitly with talk of the <em>Word</em> that created everything becoming flesh and the <em>I am He</em> of the Garden of Gethsemane &ndash; Jesus is God.</p>
<p>After this comes three cycles of cataclysmic events &ndash; seven seals broken, seven trumpet blasts, and seven bowls of plagues. The third cycle focuses on an unholy trinity &ndash; a beast from the sea, a beast from the earth, and a false prophet. John tells us later that the first beast is the ancient dragon who has been deceiving the world from the beginning. The second beast is a leader &ndash; a pseudo-christ or false messiah. The third is a false prophet who works miracles on behalf of the second beast (Rev 19.20).</p>
<p>To finish off we will look at how John gives us a hint about the identity of the second beast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, and he decrees that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Revelation+of+John+13%3A16#cv">Rev 13.16-18 NASB</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a picture of a Greek manuscript (late third century AD) that includes this part of Revelation:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Code-CB-Pap-3.png" alt="P47"></p>
<p>You can see the number of the beast written in letters with a line across the top &ndash; that&rsquo;s how they used to write numbers back then.</p>
<p>Some manuscripts don&rsquo;t have 666 but instead have letters with a numerical value of 616. How do we deal with that? Here&rsquo;s what Bruce M. Metzger says on page 676 of his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Textual-Commentary-Greek-Testament-Ancient/dp/1598561642">Textual commentary on the Greek New Testament</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Greek letters are used as numerals the difference between 666 and 616 is merely a change from ξ to ι (666 = χξς and 616 = χις). Perhaps the change was intentional, seeing that the Greek form Neron Caesar written in Hebrew characters (נרונ קסר) is equivalent to 666, whereas the Latin form Nero Caesar (נרו קסר) is equivalent to 616.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. Sound out Nero&rsquo;s name in Greek, write it down in Hebrew, then add up the numerical values of the Hebrew letters and you get 666; say it in Latin and do the same thing and you get 616. Rather than the textual variants seen in the manuscripts saying different things, they say the same thing. The beast is Caesar, and Nero in particular.</p>
<p>Well, that brings us to the end. Revelation is about <em>things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things</em>. Have they happened, are they happening now, or have they yet to happen? Perhaps it&rsquo;s all three. Past, present, and future are strangely mixed in John&rsquo;s Apocalypse &ndash; which may be entirely appropriate for things seen in a place where normal categories of time do not necessarily apply.</p>
<p>Revelation promises a blessing upon all who read it, and I commend it to you as a book that deserves to be read rather than unread, a book that begins to reveal its secrets as you begin to understand its codes.</p>
<p>I hope that you have been somehow blessed by this expedition into the obscure realms of hidden identities and secret codes. I hope that it will give you a new angle on some hard to understand parts of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
