Good advice
I once had the good fortune to meet someone named Ellis Potter:

Mr Potter, a native Californian now residing in Switzerland, is a former Buddhist monk who became a Christian under the influence and ministry of the late Dr. Francis Schaeffer. Mr Potter&rsquo;s dramatic conversion came about as a direct result of several intense, personal discussions with Dr. Schaeffer during the turbulent seventies.

<h2 id="good-advice">Good advice</h2>
<p>I once had the good fortune to meet someone named <a href="http://ellis-potter.com/">Ellis Potter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr Potter, a native Californian now residing in Switzerland, is a former Buddhist monk who became a Christian under the influence and ministry of the late Dr. Francis Schaeffer. Mr Potter&rsquo;s dramatic conversion came about as a direct result of several intense, personal discussions with Dr. Schaeffer during the turbulent seventies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Mr Potter said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sermon of Peter at Pentecost is a good model.  A sermon should proclaim Christ and invite people to believe in Him.  It should explain Scripture and connect the Old and New Testaments.  It should comfort those who need comforting and rebuke those whose behavior is unchristian.  It should tell stories to illustrate its points. It should apply Scripture to contemporary life and teach people how to live and think as followers of Jesus.  This kind of message is good, rich and nourishing food.  If you are a preacher, preach like this to bless your people.</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems like good advice so here goes.</p>
<h2 id="todays-reading">Today&rsquo;s reading</h2>
<p>The reading from Numbers is one of the lectionary readings for today. You might know that the lectionary is an ancient tradition that says what to read on particular days. It really is ancient, possibly going back to the second century (i.e. some time between 100 and 200 AD). You have a choice of readings, and I&rsquo;ve chosen the first part of this one. It tells us about Moses at the end of his tether and about <em>manna</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-exodus">The Exodus</h2>
<p>Do you remember the story of the Exodus? When the sons of Israel (i.e. the twelve tribes descended from Jacob&rsquo;s sons) came out of Egypt, they didn&rsquo;t go straight to the Promised Land but instead spent forty years wandering around in the wilderness. Please tell me some of the things that happened when they first came out of Egypt.</p>
<h2 id="a-cloud-by-day-and-a-fire-by-night">A cloud by day and a fire by night</h2>
<p>One of the things that happened was that they were lead around by God. Here is what it says in Exodus chap. 13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LORD went before them, by day in the form of a pillar of cloud to show them the way, and by night in the form of a pillar of fire to give them light: thus they could continue their march by day and by night. The pillar of cloud never failed to go before the people during the day, nor the pillar of fire during the night.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Ex 13.21-22, Jerusalem Bible]</p>
<p>So they were shown the way by a cloud and a light that never failed them.</p>
<p>Can you think of anything in the New Testament relating to clouds and light?
There is that time when Jesus took Peter, James, and John up a mountain then was transformed before them so that his clothes became dazzling white. Then Moses and Elijah appeared and started talking to Jesus. Then a cloud appeared and a voice from the cloud said <em>This is my Son &ndash; listen to him.</em> Then they saw no one, except Jesus. <a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Mark+9%3A2#cv">Mark 9.2-8</a></p>
<p>There is also that time when Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the light of the world; anyone who follows me will not be walking in the dark; he will have the light of life.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Exodus+13%3A21#cv">John 8.12 JB</a></p>
<p>For context, Jesus said this when he was arguing with the religious authorities, who by then wanted to do away with him. It was during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot">feast of tabernacles</a>, which is when the people went up to Jerusalem and stayed in makeshift huts to remember when God made them live in huts in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Jesus says he is the light of the world in the context of a festival that remembers Israel&rsquo;s time in tents. One would not be wrong to understand that Jesus is hinting that <em>he</em> is the timeless pillar of light who still goes ahead of Israel.</p>
<p>There is another way in which Jesus is the light, and that is when he restores sight to the blind. Chapter 4 of Luke&rsquo;s Gospel tells us that Jesus began his mission by reading from the Book of Isaiah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to set at liberty those who are bruised</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>to preach the favorable year of the Lord.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Luke 4.18-19, Authorized Version]</p>
<p>Those who have suffered through my previous messages will know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiasmus">chiastic structure</a>, where the first and last lines of a passage have a common theme, as do the second and second last, and so on. This structure emphasizes the central theme, in which case the heart of the matter when Jesus announces his mission is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind.</p></blockquote>
<p>Deliverance of the captives is what God did when he set the Israelite slaves free by bringing the ten plagues upon Egypt. Recovery of sight to the blind is what Jesus does when he opens our eyes and also when he lights our path. (By the way, the <em>favourable year of the Lord</em> refers to the Jubilee, a system whose purpose is to ensure that none of the Israelites ends up back in perpetual slavery.) There is much to say on Jesus opening our eyes. John&rsquo;s account of the man born blind dwells on this. I hope to write a message about that one day.</p>
<h2 id="water-from-the-rock">Water from the rock</h2>
<p>Moving right along, another thing God does for the Israelites is to provide them with water during their trek through the wilderness. You can read about it at <a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Numbers+20%3A1#cv">Numbers 20.1-13</a>. It&rsquo;s just like the reading we heard before &ndash; the people say they would rather be dead than be in this terrible place, Moses takes it to God, and God provides in a way that only God can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also where Moses does something wrong. God says to him straight afterwards, <em>Because you did not believe that I could proclaim my holiness in the eyes of the sons of Israel, you shall not lead this assembly into the land I am giving them.</em> No one is quite sure exactly what Moses did wrong, but we are told it is to do with unbelief.</p>
<p>Does the New Testament have anything to say about water? One place that stands out is John&rsquo;s account of when a woman met Jesus at a well. Jesus says, <em>Give me a drink.</em> The woman says, <em>You&rsquo;re a Jew and I&rsquo;m a Samaritan and you&rsquo;re asking me for a drink?</em> He says, <em>If you knew what God is offering, you would ask me for a drink of running water.</em> She says, <em>Where&rsquo;s your bucket?</em> He says, <em>Anyone who drinks the water I give will never thirst again.</em> She says, <em>Sir, let me have this water.</em></p>
<p>She then went to her people saying, <em>Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did; I wonder if he is the Christ?</em> According to the Eastern Orthodox church, the woman&rsquo;s name is <a href="https://orthodoxwiki.org/Photine_of_Samaria">Photina</a>, which means <em>little light</em>. They also call her <em>equal to the apostles</em>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another place where John talks about Jesus and water. It was at the same feast of tabernacles where Jesus said <em>I am the light</em>. John says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the last day, the most important day of the Festival, Jesus stood up and said at the top of his voice, &lsquo;If anyone is thirsty, let them come to me and have a drink. For the person who comes to faith in me, just as the Scripture passage said, &ldquo;Rivers of running water will flow from within them.&rdquo;&rsquo; (He said this about the Spirit, whom those who had come to faith in him were about to receive&hellip;)</p></blockquote>
<p>[John 7.37-39a, Under the Southern Cross]</p>
<p>You might know that the word for <em>Spirit</em> is also the word for <em>breath,</em> both in Greek and Hebrew. Just as air, and water, and food are essential for physical life, so the Spirit, and Water, and Bread of Heaven are essential for everlasting life.</p>
<h2 id="bread-of-heaven">Bread of Heaven</h2>
<p>So what is the Bread of Heaven? It&rsquo;s a bit of a mystery. The original bread of heaven was the manna that God gave the Israelites to sustain them in the desert. Here is what it says in Exodus chapter 16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “It is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Exodus+16%3A15#cv">Ex 16:15 NASB</a></p>
<p>That is what <em>manna</em> means in Hebrew: <em>What is it?</em></p>
<p>God had already told Moses that he would feed the people. Earlier in Exodus chap. 16 it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, so that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My instruction.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Exodus+16%3A4#cv">Ex 16:4 NASB</a></p>
<p>One of God&rsquo;s instructions was to get only enough for their daily needs. However, when they disobeyed and gathered too much, the manna went rotten and stunk.</p>
<p>The Bible reading from Numbers chapter 11 that we had earlier tells us more about manna:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium&hellip; When the dew came down on the camp at night, the manna would come down with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>[Numbers 11.7,9]</p>
<p>A fun fact is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander#Origin_and_history">earliest archaeological evidence of coriander seed</a> is from the land of Israel. According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bdellium">Bdellium</a> is <em>a semi-transparent oleo-gum resin extracted from Commiphora wightii plants, and from Commiphora africana trees growing in sub-saharan Africa. According to Pliny the best quality came from Bactria. Other named sources for the resin are India, Pakistan, Arabia, Media, and Babylon&hellip; [It] is used in perfumery, as incense, and in traditional medicine.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/Bdellium.jpeg" alt="Bdellium"></p>
<p>Turning to the New Testament, can you think of anywhere that talks about bread from heaven?</p>
<p>In John&rsquo;s Gospel, Jesus says <em>I am the bread of life.</em> This was the day after he fed five thousand men with a little boy&rsquo;s supply of five buns and two fish. Women and children were there as well, so let&rsquo;s call it more than ten thousand people. Afterwards they collected twelve baskets of left-over bread.</p>
<p>The people he fed went searching for Jesus the next day and found him at Capernaum on the other side of the lake. When they found him they said, <em>Rabbi, when did you arrive here?</em> He said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am telling you the solemn truth: you are looking for me, not because you saw the miraculous signs, but because you ate some of the bread and had your fill. Don&rsquo;t toil for the food that goes off, but for the food that endures to eternal life, the food that the Son of Man will give you. For it is he on whom the Father, God, has set his seal.</p></blockquote>
<p>[John 6.26-27 USC]</p>
<p>Then they said, <em>What must we do in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s works?</em> Jesus said, <em>This is God&rsquo;s work, that you come to faith in the One he sent.</em> (The Greek word that Doctor Moore translates here as <em>faith</em> has various shades of meaning which include <em>trust</em>, <em>rely on</em>, and <em>believe</em>. See e.g. Barclay Newman&rsquo;s <em>Concise Greek-English Dictionary of the New Testament.</em>) John&rsquo;s account goes straight on to say that they then asked him for a miraculous sign so that they could believe in him, and even gave an example of the kind of miracle they wanted: God giving them bread from heaven to eat. This is kind of funny, because Jesus had done precisely that the day before.</p>
<p>Jesus then went on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am telling you the solemn truth: Moses didn&rsquo;t give you bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the real bread from heaven. For it is God&rsquo;s bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then they said, <em>Master, give us this bread for all time.</em> At this point he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am the bread that gives life; no-one who comes to me feels hungry, and no-one who comes to faith in me will ever feel thirsty.</p></blockquote>
<p>[John 6.28-35 USC]</p>
<p>The bit about not getting thirsty is reminiscent of the woman at the well. She said <em>Sir, let me have this water</em> and these people said <em>Master, give us this bread.</em> However, there is a contrast: she believed Jesus but the people he had fed did not; she received what Jesus had to give but they turned away.</p>
<p>Remembering Ellis Potter&rsquo;s advice about preaching like Peter, here is the comfort: God&rsquo;s work is to believe in the one he sent. That&rsquo;s who to focus on. Here is the rebuke: Don&rsquo;t try to do God&rsquo;s work without relying on the Bread of Heaven. There&rsquo;s no future in it.</p>
<h2 id="super-being-bread">Super being bread</h2>
<p>Where else do we hear about bread in the New Testament? For one thing, it says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, which means <em>house of bread.</em> Another place is when his disciples asked Jesus to teach them how to pray:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Father, who is in heaven, hallowed be your name</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>your kingdom come, your will be done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>give us today our daily bread</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and lead us not into hard testing, but rescue us from evil.</p></blockquote>
<p>The line in the middle, <em>Give us this day our daily bread,</em> is somewhat mysterious. The word translated as <em>daily</em> is actually a very rare word &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t occur in any surviving ancient Greek works except the Gospels. The word is ἐπιούσιος (<em>epiousios</em>). We can try to get a sense of its meaning by breaking it down: ἐπι can be translated as <em>over</em> and ούσιος can be translated as <em>essence</em> or <em>existence</em> or just <em>daily</em>. Barclay Newman&rsquo;s <em>Concise Greek-English Dictionary of the New Testament</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>of doubtful meaning: for today; for the coming day; necessary for existence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Around 380 AD, Jerome used the Latin word <em>supersubstantialem</em> to translate it. I suppose that ἐπιούσιος could mean anything from <em>daily</em> to <em>essential</em> to <em>substantial</em> to <em>super being</em>. I like that last one: <em>Give us today our super being bread.</em></p>
<h2 id="gods-provision">God&rsquo;s provision</h2>
<p>This message started with Ellis Potter commending Peter&rsquo;s speech at Pentecost as a good pattern for preachers. Something else that Mr Potter has talked about recently is poverty of spirit. During one of Peter&rsquo;s first encounters with Jesus, he was told to put out into deeper waters and let his nets down for a catch. Peter said they had been fishing all night and caught nothing. Nevertheless, he did what Jesus said. The result was a catch so huge that the boats began to sink. At this point Peter fell before Jesus and said, <em>Leave me, Master, for I am a sinful man.</em> I like to think that Jesus was looking at Peter when he said, <em>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</em></p>
<p>This brings us back to the reading from Numbers, with Moses in a bad way, very poor in spirit. What happened next is a good example of God&rsquo;s power being manifested through our weakness. After Moses said he wanted to die, God told him to get seventy elders together. Then God said, <em>I will take some of the spirit which is on you and put it on them.</em> When Moses had gathered the seventy, God came down in a cloud and gave them some of the spirit, at which point they prophesied, just like happened much later at Pentecost. Two people who were meant to turn up stayed in their tents but God gave them the spirit anyway, and they prophesied too. This bothered Joshua, who said, <em>My Lord Moses, stop them!</em> But Moses said, <em>Are you jealous on my account? If only the whole people of God were prophets, and God gave his Spirit to them all!</em></p>
<p>God is keen to give us his Spirit. The way to do God&rsquo;s work is to rely on the one he has sent, to trust the Living Water not to fail, to depend on the Bread of Heaven to provide for us.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
