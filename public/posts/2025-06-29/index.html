</ul>
<h2 id="elijahs-departure">Elijah&rsquo;s departure</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Hebrew Bible reading is part of the account of Elijah&rsquo;s departure. One of the jobs God gave Elijah to do before departing was to appoint a successor. This reading has a hard saying of the first kind &ndash; it is hard to understand. After Elijah threw his cloak on Elisha, Elisha said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And Elijah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go back, for what have I done to you?</p></blockquote>
<p>Any ideas what Elijah means by this?</p>
<p>What are we supposed to do when we find a part of the Bible that is hard to understand? One thing we can do is ask our minister Samuel what it means. Another thing we can do is ask God to show us what it means. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M%C3%BCller">George Müller</a>, the one who set up the orphanage in Bristol, recommended this as better.</p>
<p>God, please show us what Elijah means.</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, here is my take on this hard saying. To give some context, Wikipedia says the following on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah">Elijah</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elijah or Elias was a prophet and miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Ahab (9th century BC), according to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible. In 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of the Hebrew deity [God] over that of the Canaanite deity Baal. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection, bringing fire down from the sky, and ascending to heaven alive. He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as &ldquo;the sons of the prophets.&rdquo; Following Elijah&rsquo;s ascension, his disciple and devoted assistant Elisha took over as leader of this school.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Elijah was a prophet. Many think that means he could predict the future but it might be better to describe a prophet as someone who says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God told me to tell you, &ldquo;yada, yada, yada&hellip;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>One problem is that a person who says this might not actually be a prophet. Did you ever hear about the man who went to visit an assessment facility? He met someone there who said, <em>I&rsquo;m Napoleon Bonaparte</em>. The visitor said, <em>Who told you that?</em> The inmate said, <em>God told me!</em> Then another inmate said, <em>No I didn&rsquo;t!</em></p>
<p>Sorry about that. Anyway, to give some more context, here&rsquo;s what happened to Elijah a while before he threw his cloak on Elisha. You may remember the contest on Mount Carmel when Elijah wanted the Israelites to choose between God and Baal. (Carmel is located next to the city of Haifa in modern day Israel.) Fire fell from heaven and consumed Elijah&rsquo;s offering after the prophets of Baal had been dancing around all day with no result. Elijah then put the prophets of Baal to the sword. What happened then is recorded at the beginning of 1 Kings, chapter 19:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “So may the gods do to me and more so, if by about this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the life of one of them.” And he was afraid, and got up and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah; and he left his servant there. But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree; and he asked for himself to die, and said, “Enough! Now, Lord, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=I+Kings+19%3A1#cv">1 Kings 19.1-4 NASB</a></p>
<p>Elijah was in a bad way but the Angel of the LORD gave him food and drink. Elijah regained his strength and went forty days into the wilderness, ending up in a cave on Mount Horeb, the Mountain of God. There, the word of the LORD came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” Elijah said why he was there, to which the word of the LORD said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before the LORD.”</p>
<p>Here is how the New American Standard Bible puts what happened next:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And behold, the LORD was passing by! And a great and powerful wind was tearing out the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire, a sound of a gentle blowing. When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=I+Kings+19%3A11#cv">1 Kings 19.11-13 NASB</a></p>
<p>The King James Version has <em>a still small voice</em> where the NASB has <em>a sound of a gentle blowing</em>. Elijah recognised God&rsquo;s own voice in that sound of silence and covered his face with his cloak. Why? Probably because he was afraid to look directly at God. Then God said the same thing that word of the LORD had just said: <em>What are you doing here Elijah?</em></p>
<p>This returns us to where today&rsquo;s reading from 1 Kings starts. God sends Elijah back with instructions that included appointing a successor. When someone appoints a successor it means they are getting ready for departure, and that&rsquo;s how it was for Elijah. He found Elisha ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen and threw his cloak on him. This was the same cloak that had recently been in God&rsquo;s presence. The twelve yoke of oxen were twelve separate teams &ndash; a bit like having twelve tractors ploughing your field. That means Elisha&rsquo;s father had a big farm and was probably well off.</p>
<p>So what does Elijah mean when he says to Elisha, <em>Go back, for what have I done to you?</em> I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe he&rsquo;s saying what God just said to him: <em>Go back.</em> Or maybe he&rsquo;s saying <em>What have I done to you?</em> because a prophet&rsquo;s life is not a walk in the park. Or maybe he&rsquo;s saying, <em>Do whatever. I didn&rsquo;t do anything to you but God just did.</em> When someone is touched by God, something happens.</p>
<h2 id="christs-departure">Christ&rsquo;s departure</h2>
<p>The New Testament reading is from Luke&rsquo;s Gospel. Both of today&rsquo;s readings relate to an imminent departure: the first Elijah&rsquo;s and this one Christ&rsquo;s. Jesus has set his face for Jerusalem knowing full well what awaits him there. Now we come to some hard sayings of the second kind: we know what they mean but we don&rsquo;t like what they say.</p>
<p>There are parallels between the account of Elijah and Elisha and the events portrayed in this part of Luke. The first thing is fire from heaven. As happens often, the disciples get it wrong. Jesus was a miracle worker who did astounding things, some reminiscent of Elijah. Just as Elijah had done, Jesus brought a poor woman&rsquo;s son back from the dead. Indeed, some people thought Jesus was Elijah. I don&rsquo;t know what James and John were thinking, but they asked Jesus if they should call down fire from heaven to consume the Samaritans who did not welcome him. Luke says that Jesus told them off. According to numerous manuscripts, versions, and patristic witnesses he continued on to say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You do not know what kind of spirit you are of. For the Son of man did not come to destroy lives but to save them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next, someone said <em>I will follow you wherever you go</em> to which Jesus replied,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus gives that person no illusions concerning what it means to follow him wherever he goes: you might end up homeless.</p>
<p>Jesus encountered another man and said, <em>Follow me.</em> The man said, <em>Lord, first let me go and bury my father.</em></p>
<p>Jesus replied with another hard saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you are to go and announce God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another man said something just like what Elisha said when Elijah threw his cloak on him: <em>I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to those at my home.</em></p>
<p>Jesus replied with today&rsquo;s final hard saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one who puts their hand to the plow and looks back is fit for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="blessed-are-the-poor">Blessed are the poor</h2>
<p>Where do we go from here? Who am I to tell you to renounce your home, your obligations, and your family for the kingdom of God? I can&rsquo;t do it, but there is a voice that can. That voice is the word of God, and John tells us that this voice is a person:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now for a story about someone who heard that voice and obeyed it. These days people who hear a voice are assessed in a facility and told to take the blue pill. However, back when this person heard the voice the people didn&rsquo;t do that. Instead, they threw mud and rocks at him. His name was Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone.</p>
<p>We in this church are trying to do something to engage with the people who live around here. As part of our efforts, we have stolen a couple of Giovanni&rsquo;s ideas. One is the animal blessing, which we just had, and the other is the nativity scenes, which we plan for the lead up to Christmas. Giovanni is better known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi">Francis of Assisi</a>.</p>
<p>Jesus said <em>Blessed are the poor</em> and Francis ended up proving this truth. Francis of Assisi was born about 850 years ago, around 1181 AD. He didn&rsquo;t start off poor. His father was a cloth merchant and was loaded. Francis used to live it up. He wanted to be a soldier and around the age of twenty went off to fight against a neighbouring city-state. It didn&rsquo;t go well and he was captured, becoming a prisoner of war for a year. He got sick but also had plenty of time to think. After his release he went back to Assisi and his former way of life.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards he decided to join another war. The night before he left he had a dream. There was a great hall lined with pieces of armour marked with the cross. A voice said <em>These are for you and your soldiers.</em> Francis thought this meant he was destined for success as a soldier. On his way to the war he got sick again. He had another dream and the same voice said <em>Go back to Assisi.</em> Francis obeyed. It was 1205 AD and he was about 24 years old.</p>
<p>Upon his return his friends noticed a change in Francis. They thought maybe he had fallen in love and wanted to get married. He said, <em>Yes, I am about to take a wife of surpassing fairness.</em> He was talking about marrying Lady Poverty. He began to seek an answer to his call in prayer and solitude. One day he came across a leper and instinctively recoiled. But then he overcame his natural aversion and hugged the man, emptied his pockets and gave it all to him. Then Francis made a pilgrimage to Rome and again emptied his wallet, this time at the tomb of Saint Peter. He swapped his clothes with a beggar and spent the rest of the day fasting with the beggars at the door of the basilica.</p>
<p>Not long after his return to Assisi, he was praying before a crucifix in a run down church. A voice said <em>Go, Francis, and repair my house, which as you see is falling into ruin.</em> Francis took it literally. He went home, got a lot of his father&rsquo;s expensive cloth, took it to the market, sold it, then took the proceeds to the priest who looked after the ruined church. The priest was in an ethical dilemma and refused the money, which Francis then threw on the ground. To avoid his father, Francis hid in a cave for a month. When he returned to Assisi he was half starved and dirty. A crowd followed him, throwing mud and rocks at him, and calling him a madman. His father grabbed him, beat him, bound him, and locked him up.</p>
<p>His mother let him go when his father went off on a business trip. Francis went straight back to the ruined church. When his father returned he decided to disinherit Francis, who was taken before the authorities. There he took off his clothes and gave them to his father with these words: <em>Until now I have called you my father on earth; from now on I want to say &lsquo;Our Father who art in Heaven.&rsquo;</em> Francis wandered into the hills behind Assisi, making up songs of praise to God as he went. He came across some robbers and said <em>I am the herald of the great King</em>. They threw him in a snow drift.</p>
<p>The story of Francis goes on and on but you will be glad to know that I am finishing now. If you want to find out more, go and look up Francis on the <a href="https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=4829">Interweb</a>. He lived another twenty years and achieved much. Little by little, people began to hear the One speaking through him. Some even joined in his life of poverty, chastity, and obedience: poverty manifest as trust in God&rsquo;s provision; chastity manifest as love, integrity, and purity of relationship; obedience manifest as listening to the still small voice of God. Later, Clare joined the movement and so began the Poor Clares. They cared for Francis when his poor body could no longer take the rigours of ascetic life. While under their care he composed his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canticle_of_the_Sun">Canticle of the Sun</a>. Early in the 1900s, William Francis Draper translated the Canticle into a song for the children in his church: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Creatures_of_Our_God_and_King">All creatures of our God and King</a>.</p>
<p>We hear echoes of Christ&rsquo;s hard sayings in the lives of Elijah, Elisha, and Francis. Elisha went back and said goodbye to his mother and father but then embraced the work as Elijah&rsquo;s successor. He sacrificed his oxen, turning them into a farewell feast for those he was leaving behind. Faced with rejection, Francis did not ask for fire to fall on his enemies; instead he prayed for their salvation. Foxes have holes and birds their nests but Francis had nowhere to lay his head. He went out and announced God&rsquo;s kingdom instead of burying his father.</p>
<p>Not all of us lead a life like Elijah or Elisha or Francis. Once, after hearing his words of spirit and life, an entire village asked to join Francis and his order of life. Francis instead created a special order of his movement for people like them &ndash; one that allowed them to continue their lives as ordinary people but called for them not to carry arms, take oaths, or engage in lawsuits.</p>
<p>God speaks to people in different ways. Sometimes it&rsquo;s spectacular: like a fire, an earthquake, a tornado, or a prophet&rsquo;s cloak. Other times it is unspectacular: like a dream or a still quiet voice. The circumstances don&rsquo;t matter as much as the voice who speaks, the one who became a human being and lived among us. When he speaks, God speaks. Once some people asked Jesus, <em>What must we do to accomplish God&rsquo;s works?</em> Jesus said,  <em>This is God&rsquo;s work: that you trust in the one he sent.</em> God calls us to follow him; he also enables us to do it. The power to do God&rsquo;s work is tied to trusting the One God sent, who is Jesus Christ, the Rock of Ages, broken for our sake, now raised to God&rsquo;s right hand where he intercedes for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing in my hands I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress,
Helpless, look to Thee for grace.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen</p>
