Blessed are you our God, creator of the Universe, who said Let there be light, and there was light.

Today I&rsquo;m going rogue and breaking with the lectionary:


Gen 1.1-3 (God makes light)


John 1.1-5 (In the beginning was the Word)


John 9.1-7 (A blind man is cured)


A dangerous occupation
Today we will look at when Jesus cured a man born blind, an account found in the ninth chapter of John&rsquo;s Gospel. The ancient church attributes this Gospel to John, AKA the disciple whom Jesus loved. Was John full of himself to say that he was the disciple Jesus loved? I think a better explanation is that the people around John &ndash; who helped him write this literary masterpiece (see e.g. John 21.24) &ndash; were protecting him by not giving out his real name. Being a Christian was becoming more and more hazardous back in the 60s of the first century, and being a leader of the Christian movement was almost invariably fatal. John was the last left standing of the early Christian leadership: James &ndash; brother of Jesus &ndash; had been killed by the Sanhedrin and Peter and Paul had been killed by Nero. Years earlier, John&rsquo;s own brother, James the Apostle, had been killed by one of the Herods. That Herod would have killed Peter too if not for Peter being broken out of jail. (See Acts 12.1-17.) The early Christians did other things that fit the pattern of not giving away too much. Here are a few examples:">

<h2 id="a-dangerous-occupation">A dangerous occupation</h2>
<p>Today we will look at when Jesus cured a man born blind, an account found in the ninth chapter of John&rsquo;s Gospel. The ancient church attributes this Gospel to John, AKA <em>the disciple whom Jesus loved</em>. Was John full of himself to say that he was the disciple Jesus loved? I think a better explanation is that the people around John &ndash; who helped him write this literary masterpiece (see e.g. <a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+21%3A24#cv">John 21.24</a>) &ndash; were protecting him by not giving out his real name. Being a Christian was becoming more and more hazardous back in the 60s of the first century, and being a leader of the Christian movement was almost invariably fatal. John was the last left standing of the early Christian leadership: James &ndash; brother of Jesus &ndash; had been killed by the Sanhedrin and Peter and Paul had been killed by Nero. Years earlier, John&rsquo;s own brother, James the Apostle, had been killed by one of the Herods. That Herod would have killed Peter too if not for Peter being broken out of jail. (See <a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+12%3A1#cv">Acts 12.1-17</a>.) The early Christians did other things that fit the pattern of not giving away too much. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+12%3A17#cv">Acts 12.17</a> Luke, who no doubt knew exactly where Peter was, just said <em>Peter went to another place</em>;</li>
<li>the author of Hebrews is not identified;</li>
<li>Christians used something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomina_sacra">nomina sacra</a> when they wrote words that would give away the writing as Christian. (<em>Nomina sacra</em> make names look like numbers so a half-literate soldier or policeman might have thought he was looking at tax receipt instead of a Christian book.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>They say you should look at the context when reading the Bible. Let&rsquo;s start by looking at John himself. He seems to have been one of the youngest apostles. He also seems to have had connections among the Hebrew aristocracy, the priestly set known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees">Sadducees</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Josephus, writing at the end of the 1st century CE, associates the sect with the upper echelons of Judean society. As a whole, they fulfilled various political, social, and religious roles, including maintaining the Temple in Jerusalem.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the anonymous disciple mentioned at <a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+18%3A15#cv">John 18.15</a> is John himself then he was known to the High Priest. That&rsquo;s why he could get into the High Priest&rsquo;s house when Jesus was taken there after being arrested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a> (which, by the way, means <em>oil press</em>).</p>
<p>Being a Hebrew, John would have been fed on the Hebrew Bible from an early age. The Eastern Orthodox Church calls him <em>John the Theologian</em>. He knows all about the Exodus, the festivals, and what they celebrate. He knows all about the God of the Hebrews and the names by which he is known, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton">I Am</a> name that God told Moses when Moses said <em>Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?</em>.</p>
<p>John was a man of numbers. He tells us there were six water jars of two or three measures each at Cana. According to my Jerusalem Bible&rsquo;s table of weights and measures, a Greek measure is about 39.4 L. That means that Jesus made the equivalent of somewhere between 630 and 945 bottles of good wine for the wedding guests. John also likes the number seven. In his Gospel there are seven signs done by Jesus that Hebrews know only God can do: changing water into wine; curing at a distance; curing someone crippled for decades; feeding thousands of people with a boy&rsquo;s lunch; walking on water; curing someone born blind; and raising someone who was well and truly dead. Jesus also has seven <em>I am</em> titles in John&rsquo;s Gospel: <em>I am the bread of life</em> (<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+6%3A35#cv">John 6.35</a>); <em>I am the light of the world</em> (<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+8%3A12#cv">8.12</a>); <em>I am the gate</em> (<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+10%3A7#cv">10.7</a>); <em>I am the good shepherd</em> (<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+10%3A11#cv">10.11</a>); <em>I am the resurrection and the life</em> (<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+11%3A25#cv">11.25</a>), <em>I am the way, the truth, and the life</em> (<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+14%3A6#cv">14.6</a>); and <em>I am the true vine</em> (<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+15%3A1#cv">15.1</a>). Or should that be eight? Jesus also says <em>πριν αβρααμ γενεσθαι εγω ειμι</em>; that is, <em>before Abraham was born, I am</em> (<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=John+8%3A58#cv">John 8.58</a>).</p>
<h2 id="more-context">More context</h2>
<p>Now for some more context. John&rsquo;s Gospel records an ongoing dialog with Jesus on one side and <em>the Jews</em> on the other. When John says <em>the Jews</em> he does not mean all Jewish people. For one thing, Jesus and all of his followers were Jewish. Instead, John means the powerful groups who ran the religious show: groups like the Sadducees and another group called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, meaning the <em>separate</em>. Pharisees were big on the Law of Moses. To use a rough analogy, Sadducees were the priestly establishment &ndash; something like politically connected Catholics and Anglicans. Pharisees, on the other hand, were the seriously religious commoners &ndash; something like today&rsquo;s evangelicals and charismatics who emphasize the written code.</p>
<p>The dialog with the Jewish establishment starts with them asking John the Baptist, <em>Who are you?</em> JB says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the Messiah.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then they say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah nor the Prophet, why do you carry out baptisms?</p></blockquote>
<p>JB says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I baptize in water; among you stands someone whose identity you don&rsquo;t know, who is coming along later in time than I. I don&rsquo;t deserve even to release the leather straps on his sandals.</p></blockquote>
<p>[John 1.19-26 USC]</p>
<p>After this there is a conversation between Jesus and a Pharisee named Nicodemus. (By the way, Nicodemus is a Greek name. It means something like <em>victory of the commoners</em>.) Nicodemus starts by saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rabbi, we are well aware that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no-one would be capable of performing these miraculous signs that you are performing unless God were with them.</p></blockquote>
<p>As he often does, Jesus replies with something that seems to have nothing to do with what the other person just said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am telling you the solemn truth: unless a person is born from above, they aren&rsquo;t able to see God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later Jesus tells Nicodemus,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who puts their faith in him may have eternal life.</p></blockquote>
<p>[John 3.5-15 USC] (RKM translates <em>the Son of Man</em> as <em>Humanity&rsquo;s Son</em>.)</p>
<p>Next comes one of the most famous passages in the New Testament, John 3.16-17. God sent his only son into the world so that everyone who believes in him can have eternal life. God didn&rsquo;t send him to condemn the world but to save it. Then Jesus gives what what sounds like a legal verdict:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who puts their faith in the Son of Man isn&rsquo;t condemned. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t put their faith in the Name of God&rsquo;s Son stands condemned because the light has come into the world; they prefer darkness to light because they don&rsquo;t want their corruption to be exposed. However, people who put the truth into practice come to the light so that it will be revealed that their deeds have been achieved through God.</p></blockquote>
<p>[John 3.16-21, my hash of RKM&rsquo;s USC]</p>
<p>So much for the dialog with the Jews, which goes down hill after that.</p>
<h2 id="yet-more-context">Yet more context</h2>
<p>There is yet more context. Just before the account of the man born blind, the Jews pick up stones to throw at Jesus because he was in the Temple in Jerusalem and he said, <em>before Abraham was born, I am.</em> The Jews took this as blasphemy &ndash; only God is pre-existent. Jesus is a man claiming to be the I AM. The Law says he must die.</p>
<p>So what was Jesus doing in Jerusalem? It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot">Sukkot</a>, the Festival of Tabernacles, which happens in September or October. In this festival the people lived in tents to remember how God cared for them in the wilderness after they came out of Egypt: how God was a guiding pillar of light, and a protective cloud of presence, how he fed them with bread from heaven and gave them running water out of a rock in the desert. The festival runs for seven or eight days. Hospitality is a big emphasis. Actual guests are to be welcomed, as are seven symbolic ones as well. The symbolic guest to be welcomed on the seventh day is David. The Torah reading for that day is from chapters fourteen to sixteen of Deuteronomy. Here are a few verses from there to give you a taste of what it is about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release of debts.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Be careful that there is no mean-spirited thought in your heart, such as, ‘The seventh year, the year of release of debts, is near,’ and your eye is malicious toward your poor brother, and you give him nothing; then he may cry out to the Lord against you, and it will be a sin in you.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall generously give to him, and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him, because for this thing the Lord your God will bless you in all your work, and in all your undertakings.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the poor will not cease to exist in the land; therefore I am commanding you, saying, ‘You shall fully open your hand to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.’</p></blockquote>
<p>[<a href="https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Deuteronomy+15%3A1#cv">Deuteronomy 15.1; 15.9-11</a> NASB]</p>
<p>Another emphasis of the Festival is on water. There was a special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simchat_Beit_HaShoeivah">water ceremony</a> each day, something like a rain dance asking God to send rain at the right times. Water was taken from the spring-fed Pool of Siloam and carried up a lot of steps to the Temple and poured onto the altar as an offering. This throws light on the significance of something Jesus said on the last day of Sukkot:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the last day, the most important day of the Festival, Jesus stood up and said at the top of his voice, &lsquo;If anyone is thirsty, let them come to me and have a drink. For the person who comes to faith in me, just as the Scripture passage said, &ldquo;Rivers of running water will flow from within them.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>[John 7.37-38 USC]</p>
<h2 id="another-answer">Another answer</h2>
<p>So much for context. Now I know what you are thinking: this is going to be a long message.</p>
<p>Speaking of knowing what you are thinking, pick a number between one and ten. Now multiply it by nine. Now add up the digits in the number that you get. Now take away four. Now think of the letter that corresponds to the number you just got. You can use your fingers if you like but try not to let me see: one corresponds to A, two corresponds to B, and so on. Do you have your letter? Next, think of an animal &ndash; not a bird &ndash; whose name starts with that letter. Now think what colour the animal is. Is it grey? Has it got a trunk? Or is it browny-black and spikey? Or did you get the maths wrong?</p>
<p>You will be happy to know there is not long to go in the message.</p>
<p>Jesus was walking along. It was the end of the Festival and it was a Sabbath, the seventh day when God rested. Jesus noticed a blind man. His disciples asked a hard theological question: <em>Who sinned for him to be born blind? Was it him or his parents?</em> These were the only two options their theology had. Yet Jesus had another answer: <em>It was so that God&rsquo;s works could be revealed through him.</em></p>
<p>Jesus talks about having to do the works of the One who sent him while the day lasts, and how he himself is the world&rsquo;s light. Then he spits on the ground, makes mud with his saliva, puts it on the man&rsquo;s eyes, and tells him to go and wash in the Pool of Siloam. (John tells us that Siloam means <em>sent</em>.) The man found his way to the Pool, had a wash, and came back seeing. This caused a commotion. Some said, <em>Isn&rsquo;t he the blind beggar?</em> Others said, <em>No, it just looks like him.</em> But he said, <em>It&rsquo;s me.</em></p>
<p>Now the Pharisees stepped in and started an investigation. They asked him how he can see and he told them, <em>He put mud on my eyes, I had a wash, and now I can see.</em> They asked him who he thought Jesus was, and he said <em>He&rsquo;s a prophet.</em> Then they called in his parents and asked how he can see. They were afraid of what the Pharisees could do to them so they said, <em>Ask him &ndash; he&rsquo;s old enough.</em> Next they put the blind man under oath &ndash; <em>Give God glory! We know this man is a sinner!</em> (They said that because Jesus did the work of healing on a Sabbath and it&rsquo;s against the Law to work on the Sabbath.) The blind man says, <em>I wouldn&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s a sinner or not. But I do know this &ndash; I was blind and now I can see.</em> They asked again how he was healed. The next bit is funny. The blind man says, <em>I&rsquo;ve already told you and you didn&rsquo;t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples?</em> At this point the Pharisees lost it and began a tirade against him. The blind man replied by giving them a theology lesson &ndash; something he had no doubt heard them say in his many years of begging at the Temple: <em>God doesn&rsquo;t listen to sinners, but if anyone reveres God and carries out his wishes, he listens to them.</em> The blind man also added some new theology: <em>Since time began, it&rsquo;s unheard of that anyone gave sight to a person born blind. Unless this person were from God, he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do a thing.</em> Then, after insulting him and his parents, the Pharisees kicked him out.</p>
<p>[John 9.15-33, my hash but leaning on the USC]</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Until this point the man had never seen Jesus though he did know who had made the mud, put it on his eyes, then sent him to wash in the Pool of Siloam, the pool with the name that means <em>sent</em>, a pool fed by running water. Jesus went and found him after hearing the Pharisees had kicked him out. The man knew it was Jesus speaking because he already knew his voice.</p>
<p>Jesus said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe in the Son of Man?</p></blockquote>
<p>The man said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who is he, Lord, so that I can believe in him?</p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of what Paul said on the road to Damascus. Paul saw a blinding flash then heard a voice saying, <em>Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?</em> Paul replied, <em>Who are you Lord?</em> Both the man and Paul address Jesus as <em>Lord</em>. This word is used when speaking to someone who has power and authority.</p>
<p>Jesus says to the man,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have seen him; the same one is speaking with you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then the man said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe Lord</p></blockquote>
<p>and worshipped Jesus.</p>
<p>John has a high view of who Jesus is. He never says it outright but in a number of different ways lets us know that Jesus is God incarnate. Jewish people are commanded not to worship anyone but God. The man who used to be blind was Jewish yet he worshipped Jesus. Later on in John&rsquo;s Gospel, Thomas, also Jewish, says to Jesus, <em>My Lord and my God.</em></p>
<p>John&rsquo;s account of the man born blind is the answer to the Jewish religious establishment&rsquo;s question about who Jesus is. Jesus is the one God sent to rescue the world. Being rescued involves being born from above, an encounter with the God-Man, an encounter that gives birth to belief. The encounter is like the snake that Moses put up in the desert as a cure for people who had been bitten: the healing cost the healer his own life, yet he lives. When a blinkered theology has little to offer, the Son of Man has another answer: <em>It was so that God&rsquo;s works could be revealed through him.</em> Jesus is the <em>I am</em>, the light of the world. <em>People who put the truth into practice come to the light so that it will be revealed that their deeds have been achieved through God.</em></p>
<p>Amen</p>
