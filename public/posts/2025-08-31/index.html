<p>I lifted the picture of Jesus healing the blind man from the <a href="https://pastoralmeanderings.blogspot.com/2023/03/how-bad-can-it-get.html">Pastoral Meanderings</a> blog. Bible verses may be from the Authorized Version (AV, 1611), Jerusalem Bible (JB, 1966), Richard K. Moore&rsquo;s <em>Under the Southern Cross</em> (USC, 2014; a translation of the New Testament into Australian English), the New American Standard Bible (NASB, 2020), or the New Revised Standard Version Update Edition (NRSVue, 2021).
