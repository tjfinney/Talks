<h1 id="earth-rise">Earth rise</h1>
<p>In December 1968, three astronauts were orbiting the moon when they saw something amazing &ndash; the earth rising above the moon&rsquo;s horizon. They snapped some shots, one of which became the iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE-vOscpiNc">Earthrise</a>. Later that day (though it&rsquo;s a bit hard to define what <em>day</em> means when you&rsquo;re orbiting the moon), the astronauts broadcast a message to <em>the largest audience that had ever listened to a human voice</em>. NASA had told them to <em>do something appropriate</em>, and they decided to read from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToHhQUhdyBY">the first chapter of Genesis</a>.</p>

<p>Five hundred years ago, one man asked another man to baptize him. So began the story of the Anabaptists. The <em>what</em> Baptists? The Anabaptists. &ldquo;Ana-&rdquo; in Greek is the same as &ldquo;Re-&rdquo; in English &ndash; <em>Anabaptist</em> means <em>Rebaptizer</em>.</p>
<h2 id="gutenberg">Gutenberg</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</a> introduced the movable type printing press to Europe around the year 1450 AD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information—including revolutionary ideas—transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation, and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-nationalism, accelerated by the flowering of the European vernacular languages to the detriment of Latin&rsquo;s status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.</p>

<p>To give a bit of background, Christianity had only just been legalized. Just under three hundred years earlier, Christians began spreading the message of Jesus Christ. One early statement of faith was summarized in a five letter acronym that spelled out the Greek word for fish (ΙΧΘΥΣ):</p>

<p>Verse seven of Psalm 97 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For You are the Lord Most High over all the earth;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You are exalted far above all gods.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many agree that there is one God, though not everyone. There are places around the world today where people think that there are many gods &ndash; one for this and one for that. If something goes wrong here then you have to pray to that god over there, if you want to find out about such and such then you have to go and consult the god who lives at so and so. It&rsquo;s complicated. This is the kind of world view that prevailed at a place called Philippi in what we now call Greece when Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Luke arrived there.</p>

<p>Tonight we will look at the miracle of the five loaves and two fish from Mark&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
<h2 id="marks-gospel">Mark&rsquo;s Gospel</h2>
<p>Concerning this Gospel, a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis">Papias</a>, who was Bishop of Hierapolis (modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamukkale">Pamukkale in Turkey</a>), wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark, indeed, having been the interpreter of Peter, wrote accurately, howbeit not in order, all that he recalled of what was either said or done by the Lord. For he neither heard the Lord, nor was he a follower of his, but, at a later date (as I said), of Peter; who used to adapt his instructions to the needs [of the moment], but not with a view to putting together the Dominical oracles in orderly fashion: so Mark did no wrong in thus writing some things as he recalled them. For he kept a single aim in view: not to omit anything of what he heard, nor to state anything therein falsely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of the words are nonsensical. Axton [who wrote the song] wanted to persuade his record producers to record a new melody he had written, and the producers asked him to sing any words to the tune. A member of Three Dog Night [the band that sang it] said that the original lyrics to the song were &ldquo;Jeremiah was a prophet&rdquo; but no one liked it.</p>
