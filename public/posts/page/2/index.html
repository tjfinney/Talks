<p>To give a bit of background, Christianity had only just been legalized. Just under three hundred years earlier, Christians began spreading the message of Jesus Christ. One early statement of faith was summarized in a five letter acronym that spelled out the Greek word for fish (ΙΧΘΥΣ):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are exalted far above all gods.</p>

<p>Many agree that there is one God, though not everyone. There are places around the world today where people think that there are many gods &ndash; one for this and one for that. If something goes wrong here then you have to pray to that god over there, if you want to find out about such and such then you have to go and consult the god who lives at so and so. It&rsquo;s complicated. This is the kind of world view that prevailed at a place called Philippi in what we now call Greece when Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Luke arrived there.</p>

      <p>Tonight we will look at the miracle of the five loaves and two fish from Mark&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
<h2 id="marks-gospel">Mark&rsquo;s Gospel</h2>
<p>Concerning this Gospel, a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis">Papias</a>, who was Bishop of Hierapolis (modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamukkale">Pamukkale in Turkey</a>), wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark, indeed, having been the interpreter of Peter, wrote accurately, howbeit not in order, all that he recalled of what was either said or done by the Lord. For he neither heard the Lord, nor was he a follower of his, but, at a later date (as I said), of Peter; who used to adapt his instructions to the needs [of the moment], but not with a view to putting together the Dominical oracles in orderly fashion: so Mark did no wrong in thus writing some things as he recalled them. For he kept a single aim in view: not to omit anything of what he heard, nor to state anything therein falsely.</p>

<p>The first reading today was the call of Jeremiah. Some of you might remember a song called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKejlrT-sI">Jeremiah was a bullfrog</a>. Here&rsquo;s something you might not know about that song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the words are nonsensical. Axton [who wrote the song] wanted to persuade his record producers to record a new melody he had written, and the producers asked him to sing any words to the tune. A member of Three Dog Night [the band that sang it] said that the original lyrics to the song were &ldquo;Jeremiah was a prophet&rdquo; but no one liked it.</p>

<h2 id="why-wear-hats">Why wear hats?</h2>
<p>The first question is, why did women wear hats in the first place? It&rsquo;s probably to do with something that Paul said:</p>

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Today we are going to abandon the usual lectionary reading (which is from Mark&rsquo;s Gospel) and instead look at Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel. That&rsquo;s because we have been hearing about the bread of heaven over the last few weeks, which inspired me to talk about the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-missing">A bit missing?</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer may well be the best known piece of scripture in the Universe, but what does it actually say? Don&rsquo;t worry, we are not going to look at the grammatical analysis of each word in Greek to discover that some of the requests are aorist, active, third person, singular, imperative verbs, and things like that. Instead we will look at the structure of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer to see what might be the central point.</p>
