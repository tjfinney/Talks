      <p>Today is Trinity Sunday, and we will be looking at the part of John&rsquo;s Gospel that talks about one night when a man named Nicodemus went to talk to Jesus.  The part is chapter 3, verses 1 to 17, which includes those famous words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. [John 3.16 NASB]</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lectionary reading from Mark talks about what happened when Jesus went to church one day. He caused a bit of a stir.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They went as far as Capernaum, and as soon as the sabbath came he went to the synagogue and began to teach. And his teaching made a deep impression on them because, unlike the scribes, he taught them with authority.</p>

No ear has heard,

<p>There is a Jubilee in the Bible. You can read about it in the Book of Leviticus. The idea of the Jubilee pops up in other places as well. If you know about the Jubilee, some of the things Jesus said make more sense.</p>

      <p>What Christians now call <em>communion</em> or the <em>Last Supper</em> began as a Passover Meal that Jesus shared with his disciples the night before he was crucified. Jesus told his disciples to remember him whenever they had that meal. At a previous service we looked at certain aspects of the bread. Tonight we will look at certain aspects of the wine.</p>
<p>The Passover meal has four cups of wine but we will only have two cups tonight. We will drink grape juice, which is just as well because too many cups of wine put you over the limit. There will be something to remember about Jesus for each cup.</p>

      <p>Tonight we will look at something from Luke&rsquo;s Gospel, which tells us about what happened once when Jesus was invited to a meal. Here is how it starts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the Pharisees invited him to a meal. When he arrived at the Pharisee&rsquo;s house and took his place at table, a woman came in, who had a bad name in the town. She had heard he was dining with the Pharisee and had brought with her an alabaster jar of ointment. She waited behind him at his feet, weeping, and her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them away with her hair; then she covered his feet with kisses and anointed them with the ointment.

      <h1 id="the-ten-commandments">The ten commandments</h1>
<p>Our church has been going through the ten commandments and now we have reached the last one. God gave these commandments to the Israelites after he set them free. The commandments tell us how to honour God and respect each other. A country that obeys these commands will be set free, but any nation that ignores them is in danger of reverting to slavery.</p>
<p>The children of Israel had just been set free from Egypt. Over the last four hundred years they had gone from a position of great privilege to the worst possible situation; they began as guests of Egypt&rsquo;s governor (namely Joseph) and ended up as slaves who toiled under the Egyptian sun making bricks for Pharoah. Only a slave knows what it is like to spend your entire life working hard for someone else, then to end your days with nothing.</p>

<p>Christians are meant to be evangelists. That means we are meant to tell people the good news. The word <em>evangelist</em> comes from the Greek ευαγγελιον, which means <em>good news</em>. The word <em>gospel</em> also means <em>good news</em> but has German ancestry (as do a lot of English words).^[The <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gospel">Merriam-Webster</a> dictionary says, &ldquo;Middle English, from Old English gōdspel (translation of Late Latin evangelium), from <em>gōd</em> good + <em>spell</em> tale&rdquo;.]</p>
<p>If you are like me then you have trouble being an evangelist. I find evangelism hard, like going to the dentist. I know I should do it but I don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;d rather not go and suffer for fear of what will happen if I do go.</p>
