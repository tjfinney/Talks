<p>The First Letter of Peter is one of the seven General Letters in the New Testament: James; First and Second Peter; First, Second, and Third John; and Jude. These letters are called &ldquo;General&rdquo; because they are addressed to general groups of people instead of particular ones. Here&rsquo;s an example of a general letter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Everyone living in Australia, treat foreigners as well as you treat your own people and love them as much as you love yourself. Remember, you were once foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have been looking at what the Four Gospels say about what happened on Easter Sunday, and this week we are looking at Mark&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s Gospel appears to be an eye witness account of Jesus from the time he chose his first followers to when they ran away.</p>
<p>Eusebius, who wrote a history of the church around 300 AD, tells us what someone named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis">Papias</a> wrote about Mark. Papias lived from about 60 to 130 AD in a place called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierapolis">Hierapolis</a> in the Roman province of Asia Minor, which is now part of Turkey. This Papias was a bishop whose lifetime covered the period from when the Gospels were written to when Asia Minor had become a major centre of Christianity.</p>

      <h1 id="a-letter-from-prison">A letter from prison</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been going through Paul&rsquo;s Letter to the Philippians and today we are up to chapter three. Paul wrote this letter from prison, and he seems to have doubts about getting out alive: <em>To me life means Christ and death means gain</em> <a href="https://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Philippians+1%3A21#cv">Phil 1.21</a>.</p>
<p>Some think he was in prison in Rome, others in Ephesus, and others in Caesarea. I think the Letter fits well with his imprisonment in Caesarea after being arrested in the temple at Jerusalem. You can read about the surrounding events in Acts chapters 21 to 26. The religious establishment in Israel, who the New Testament calls <em>The Jews</em>, was after Paul and wanted him dead. (The establishment <em>Jews</em> of the New Testament should not be confused with the Jews of today &ndash; when you hear <em>Jews</em> in the New Testament, think of a powerful religious establishment that regards Christianity as a heresy.) Paul used to be one of the religious establishment until something strange happened to him on the road to Damascus. (See <a href="https://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+9%3A3#cv">Acts 9.3-9</a>.)</p>

<p>The Psalms are one of the best-loved parts of the Bible, and one of the best-loved Psalms is Psalm 23 (XXIII in Roman numerals). &ldquo;Psalm&rdquo; means &ldquo;song&rdquo;, so what better way to introduce it than to sing it?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
Even for His own Name’s sake.

Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnishèd
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;
And in God’s house forevermore
My dwelling place shall be.

      <h1 id="four-gospels">Four Gospels</h1>
<p>The Four Gospels are four versions of the Good News concerning Jesus Christ. In them the first generation of Christians tell us what they witnessed when Jesus came to town.</p>
<p>We have been handed four Gospels, those according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These are the written accounts of the Good News concerning Jesus Christ handed down to us by the first generation of Christians. They are from the time of the apostles, and can be linked with four early Christian leaders (or the missions they headed): James the Just, first bishop of Jerusalem; Peter, taking the Gospel to Jews beyond the Holy Land; Paul, apostle to the Gentiles (i.e. non-Jews); and John, the &ldquo;disciple who Jesus loved&rdquo;. At Galatians 2.9 Paul writes &ldquo;recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship&rdquo;. Cephas is better known to us as Peter. Adding Paul himself to the three &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; gives us the four. With the possible exception of Jude, the entire New Testament is attributable to these four or the missions they headed. Even Jude can be associated with James the Just, Jude being his brother.</p>

<p>The Gospel of Luke tells us that Jesus&rsquo;s public work began after his baptism by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. People thought that John the Baptist might be the Messiah, the promised saviour of Israel. So John told them this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I baptize by immersing you in water. However, someone who is stronger than I am is coming; I am not worthy even to release the straps on his sandals. He will baptize you by immersing you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.^[Luke 3.16. New Testament quotations are from Richard K. Moore&rsquo;s new translation, <em>Under the Southern Cross: The New Testament in Australian English</em>, abbreviated USC from this point forwards.]</p>

<p>This Bible study looks at a few parts of the New Testament which hint that the first Christians were keeping some secrets. The initial trigger for this study was a sentence in the Acts of the Apostles that Karen Jobes pointed out in her commentary on 1 Peter.^[Karen H. Jobes, <em>1 Peter</em> (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2005).] This sentence has been an eye-opener for me, a key to understanding some otherwise puzzling aspects of the New Testament.</p>
