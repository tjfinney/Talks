<p>The Gospel of Luke tells us that Jesus&rsquo;s public work began after his baptism by John the Baptist in the Jordan River. People thought that John the Baptist might be the Messiah, the promised saviour of Israel. So John told them this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I baptize by immersing you in water. However, someone who is stronger than I am is coming; I am not worthy even to release the straps on his sandals. He will baptize you by immersing you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.^[Luke 3.16. New Testament quotations are from Richard K. Moore&rsquo;s new translation, <em>Under the Southern Cross: The New Testament in Australian English</em>, abbreviated USC from this point forwards.]</p>

<p>Matthew, Mark, and Luke make up the three synoptic Gospels. These three have much in common but have unique elements as well. (Synoptic means “a general view, or a collection of heads or parts so arranged as to exhibit a general view of the whole.”)</p>
<p>Based on this chart^[Wikipedia, “Synoptic Gospels”], would you venture to suggest a solution to the synoptic problem?</p>

      <h1 id="christians-keeping-secrets">Christians keeping secrets</h1>
<p>This Bible study looks at a few parts of the New Testament which hint that the first Christians were keeping some secrets. The initial trigger for this study was a sentence in the Acts of the Apostles that Karen Jobes pointed out in her commentary on 1 Peter.^[Karen H. Jobes, <em>1 Peter</em> (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2005).] This sentence has been an eye-opener for me, a key to understanding some otherwise puzzling aspects of the New Testament.</p>

      <p>I love Mark&rsquo;s Gospel. An early Christian named Papias said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark, having been Peter&rsquo;s interpreter, wrote accurately though not in order all that he recalled of what was either said or done by the Lord. For he neither heard the Lord nor was he a follower of his but at a later date of Peter; who used to adapt his instuctions to the needs of the moment but not with a view to putting together the Lord&rsquo;s sayings in orderly fashion: so that Mark did no wrong in thus writing some things as he recalled them. For he kept a single aim in view: not to omit anything of what he heard nor to state anything therein falsely.^[Adapted from J. Stevenson and W. H. C. Frend (eds.), <em>A New Eusebius</em> (rev. ed.; London: SPCK, 1987) 49.]</p>

<p>Before I became a Christian I used to study a book called <em>The Three Pillars of Zen</em>. The subtitle tells us that these three pillars are teaching, practice, and enlightenment.^[Philip Kapleau (ed.), <em>The Three Pillars of Zen: Teaching, Practice, and Enlightenment</em> (Anchor Books, 1980).] Since becoming a Christian I have been studying another book, the New Testament, which began as twenty-seven individual writings that were later collected into four parts:</p>

        Gospel wheel

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <h1 id="an-old-christian-symbol">An old Christian symbol</h1>
<p>Here is a picture.</p>
<p><img src="/images/wheel.png" alt="Gospel wheel" title="Gospel wheel"></p>
<p>What do you think it is? It is actually a very old Christian symbol which represents a very good summary of the Gospel.</p>
<p><img src="/images/acrostic.png" alt="Gospel wheel unpacked" title="Gospel wheel unpacked"></p>
<p>If you look closely, you might see that these Greek letters are contained in the wheel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ι (iota)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Χ (chi)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Θ (theta)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Υ (upsilon)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Σ (sigma)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what&rsquo;s called an acrostic. The letters make a word but also spell out a sentence. It is a hidden code. The letters mean <em>fish</em> but the sentence spelled out by the letters is a simple yet profound summary of the good news which Christians call the Gospel.^[There was another way to write sigma back then &ndash; the lunate sigma, which looks like a capital C. The wheel symbol works for that form of the letter too.]</p>

<p>Sometimes people ask what book you would like to have if stuck on a desert island. These days many would prefer to take their favourite handheld device. That would be good until the batteries ran out unless you were lucky enough to have a solar-powered battery charger too. In some ways books are a better technology than electronic devices. You can drop them, leave them in the rain, or get sand in them and they still work.</p>

<p>I am honoured to be able to speak at one of your final assemblies as Manning Uniting Church. I grew up among the people in this church and you played an important part in my upbringing. Despite being disinclined to listen, I heard the oracles of God from an early age. Not that I thought much of them at the time.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s message is called “Things I have found out about God,” and there are a number of them so I had better hurry up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; on this rock I will build my church. — Jesus Christ [Matt 16.18]</p></blockquote>
<p>The church is not a building but a Christian community built on the foundation of faith in Jesus Christ. In other words, it is a community of people who are convinced that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, the Son of the living God. A great deal of Christ&rsquo;s teaching only makes sense in a community context. When he says &ldquo;you,&rdquo; he is often saying &ldquo;you&rdquo; plural, but this is lost in translation.</p>
